	abstract = {Two-photon absorption, the process by which an excited molecule or material is produced by the simultaneous absorption of two photons, has been studied extensively in recent years, from both fundamental and application points of view. On one side, the field has been expanded with the measurement of two-photon absorption spectra and cross sections for a wide range of conjugated molecules. In this contribution, we will review the two-photon properties of some of these classes of materials, and we will discuss structure/property relationships that have been developed from these investigations. On the other side, two-photon absorption has been exploited as a means to activate a variety of chemical and physical processes with sub-diffraction-limited resolution, because three-dimensional spatial confinement of the excitation volume in a material irradiated by a tightly focused laser beam can be achieved via two-photon or, more generally, multi-photon absorption processes. This characteristic has led to applications in a number of technological fields, such as microfabrication and laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. Here, we will survey material systems that have been developed to activate radical or cationic polymerization reactions, deprotection of functional groups, and singlet oxygen generation via two-photon excitation of one of the components in the system. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Ryanodine receptors (RyR) mediate sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium (Ca2+) release and influence myocyte Ca2+ homeostasis and arrhythmias. In cardiac myocytes, RyRs are found in clusters of various sizes and shapes, and RyR cluster size may critically influence normal and arrhythmogenic Ca2+ spark and wave formation. However, the actual RyR cluster sizes at specific Ca2+ spark sites have never been measured in the physiological setting. METHODS AND RESULTS:Here we measured RyR cluster size and Ca2+ sparks simultaneously to assess how RyR cluster size influences Ca2+ sparks and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak. For small RyR cluster sizes ({\textless}50), Ca2+ spark frequency is very low but then increases dramatically at larger cluster sizes. In contrast, Ca2+ spark amplitude is nearly maximal even at relatively small RyR cluster size (\${\textbackslash}approx\$10) and changes little at larger cluster size. These properties agreed with computational simulations of RyR gating within clusters. CONCLUSIONS:Our study explains how this combination of properties may limit arrhythmogenic Ca2+ sparks and wave propagation (at many junctions) while preserving the efficacy and spatial synchronization of Ca2+-induced Ca2+-release during normal excitation-contraction coupling. However, variations in RyR cluster size among individual junctions and RyR sensitivity could exacerbate heterogeneity of local sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release and arrhythmogenesis under pathological conditions.},

	abstract = {Most synapses form on small, specialized postsynaptic structures known as dendritic spines1. The influx of Ca2+ ions into such spines—through synaptic receptors and voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (VSCCs)—triggers diverse processes that underlie synaptic plasticity2. Using two-photon laser scanning microscopy3, we imaged action-potential-induced transient changes in Ca2+ concentration in spines and dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons in rat hippocampal slices4. Through analysis of the large trial-to-trial fluctuations in these transients, we have determined the number and properties of VSCCs in single spines. Here we report that each spine contains 1–20 VSCCs, and that this number increases with spine volume. We are able to detect the opening of a single VSCC on a spine. In spines located on the proximal dendritic tree, VSCCs normally open with high probability (∼0.5) following dendritic action potentials. Activation of GABAB receptors reduced this probability in apical spines to ∼0.3 but had no effect on VSCCs in dendrites or basal spines. Our studies show that the spatial distribution of VSCC subtypes and their modulatory potential is regulated with submicrometre precision.},

	abstract = {Light has been instrumental in the study of living cells since its use helped in their discovery in the late 17th century. Further, combining chemical technology with light microscopy was an essential part of the Nobel Prize for Physiology in 1906. Such landmark scientific findings involved passive observation of cells. However, over the past 50 years, a "second use" of light has emerged in cell physiology, namely one of rational control. The seminal method for this emerged in late 1970s with the invention of caged compounds. This was the point when "caged compounds" were defined as optical probes in which the active functionality of a physiological signaling molecule was blocked with a photochemical protecting group. Caged compounds are analogous to prodrugs; in both, the activity of the effector is latent. However, caged compounds, unlike prodrugs, use a trigger that confers the power of full temporal and spatial manipulation of the effects of release of its latent biological cargo. Light is distinct because it is bio-orthogonal, passes through living tissue (even into the cell interior), and initiates rapid release of the "caged" biomolecule. Further, because light can be directed to broad areas or focused to small points, caged compounds offer an array of timing scenarios for physiologists to dissect virtually any type of cellular process.The collaborative interaction between chemists and physiologists plays a fundamental role in the development of caged compounds. First, the physiologists must define the problem to be addressed; then, with the help of chemists, decide if a caged compound would be useful. For this, structure-activity relationships of the potential optical probe and receptor must be determined. If rational targets seem feasible, synthetic organic chemistry is used to make the caged compound. The crucial property of prephotolysis bio-inertness relies on physiological or biochemical assays. Second, detailed optical characterization of the caged compound requires the skill of photochemists because the rate and efficiency of uncaging are also crucial properties for a useful caged compound. Often, these studies reveal limitations in the caged compound which has been developed; thus, chemists and physiologists use their abilities for iterative development of even more powerful optical probes. A similar dynamic will be familiar to scientists in the pharmaceutical industry. Therefore, caged compound development provides an excellent training framework for (young) chemists both intellectually and professionally. In this Account, I draw on my long experience in the field of making useful caged compounds for cell physiology by showing how each probe I have developed has been defined by an important physiological problem. Fundamental to this process has been my initial training by the pioneers in aromatic photochemistry, Derek Bryce-Smith and Andrew Gilbert. I discuss making a range of "caged calcium" probes, ones which went on to be the most widely used of all caged compounds. Then, I describe the development of caged neurotransmitters for two-photon uncaging microscopy. Finally, I survey recent work on making new photochemical protecting groups for wavelength orthogonal, two-color, and ultraefficient two-photon uncaging.},

Harnessing the remarkable localization precision of DNA-PAINT ({\textless}10 nm), we visualized punctate labeling within these nanodomains, confirmed as single RyRs. RyR positions within sub-plasmalemmal nanodomains revealed how they are organized randomly into irregular clustering patterns leaving significant gaps occupied by accessory or regulatory proteins. RyR-inhibiting protein junctophilin-2 appeared highly concentrated adjacent to RyR channels. Analyzing these molecular maps showed significant variations in the co-clustering stoichiometry between junctophilin-2 and RyR, even between nearby nanodomains. This constitutes an additional level of complexity in RyR arrangement and regulation of calcium signaling, intrinsically built into the nanodomains.},

	abstract = {Nanodomains are intracellular foci which transduce signals between major cellular compartments. One of the most ubiquitous signal transducers, the ryanodine receptor (RyR) calcium channel, is tightly clustered within these nanodomains. Super-resolution microscopy has previously been used to visualize RyR clusters near the cell surface. A majority of nanodomains located deeper within cells have remained unresolved due to limited imaging depths and axial resolution of these modalities. A series of enhancements made to expansion microscopy allowed individual RyRs to be resolved within planar nanodomains at the cell periphery and the curved nanodomains located deeper within the interiors of cardiomyocytes. With a resolution of ∼ 15 nm, we localized both the position of RyRs and their individual phosphorylation for the residue Ser2808. With a three-dimensional imaging protocol, we observed disturbances to the RyR arrays in the nanometer scale which accompanied right-heart failure caused by pulmonary hypertension. The disease coincided with a distinct gradient of RyR hyperphosphorylation from the edge of the nanodomain toward the center, not seen in healthy cells. This spatial profile appeared to contrast distinctly from that sustained by the cells during acute, physiological hyperphosphorylation when they were stimulated with a β-adrenergic agonist. Simulations of RyR arrays based on the experimentally determined channel positions and phosphorylation signatures showed how the nanoscale dispersal of the RyRs during pathology diminishes its intrinsic likelihood to ignite a calcium signal. It also revealed that the natural topography of RyR phosphorylation could offset potential heterogeneity in nanodomain excitability which may arise from such RyR reorganization.},

	abstract = {1. In cardiac muscle, 'Ca2+ sparks' have been proposed to underlie Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR), and to result from openings of clusters of Ca2+ channels (ryanodine receptors; RyRs) located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. 2. To investigate the elementary nature of these Ca2+ signals directly, a diffraction-limited point source of Ca2+ was created in single cardiac myocytes by two-photon excitation photolysis of caged Ca2+. Simultaneously, concentration profiles of released Ca2+ were imaged at high temporal and spatial resolution with a laser-scanning confocal microscope. 3. This approach enabled us to generate and detect photolytic Ca2+ signals that closely resembled the Ca2+ sparks occurring naturally, not only in amplitude and size, but also in their ability to trigger additional Ca2+ sparks or Ca2+ waves. 4. Surprisingly, at low photolytic power minuscule events with estimated Ca2+ release fluxes 20-40 times smaller than those calculated for a typical Ca2+ spark were directly resolved. These events appeared to arise from the opening of a more limited number of RyRs (possibly one) or from RyRs exhibiting a different gating mode and may correspond to the elusive 'Ca2+ quark'. 5. The Ca2+ quark represents the fundamental Ca2+ release event of excitable cells implementing hierarchical Ca2+ signalling systems with Ca2+ release events of various but distinct amplitude levels (i.e. Ca2+ quarks, Ca2+ sparks and full cellular Ca2+ transients). 6. A graded recruitment of nanoscopic Ca2+ release domains (i.e. Ca2+ quarks) exhibiting variable degrees of spatial coherence and coupling may then build up intermediate Ca2+ signalling events (i.e. Ca2+ sparks). This mechanism suggests the existence of Ca2+ sparks caused by gating of a variable fraction of RyRs from within an individual cluster. Additional mobilization of a variable number of these Ca2+ sparks enables cardiac cells to show graded cellular Ca2+ transients. Similar recruitment processes may underlie regulation of Ca2+ signalling on the cellular level in general.},

	abstract = {Rationale
Intra-sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) free [Ca] ([Ca]SR) provides the driving force for SR Ca release and is a key regulator of SR Ca release channel gating during normal SR Ca release or arrhythmogenic spontaneous Ca release events. However, little is known about [Ca]SR spatiotemporal dynamics.

Objective
To directly measure local [Ca]SR with subsarcomeric spatiotemporal resolution during both normal global SR Ca release and spontaneous Ca sparks, and to evaluate the quantitative implications of spatial [Ca]SR gradients.

Methods \& Results
Intact and permeabilized rabbit ventricular myocytes were subjected to direct simultaneous measurement of cytosolic [Ca] and [Ca]SR and fluorescence recovery after photobleach (FRAP). We found no detectable [Ca]SR gradients between SR release sites (junctional SR) and Ca uptake sites (free SR) during normal global Ca release, clear spatio-temporal [Ca]SR gradients during isolated Ca blinks, faster intra-SR diffusion in the longitudinal vs. transverse direction, 3-4 fold slower diffusion of fluorophores in the SR than in cytosol, and that intra-SR Ca diffusion varies locally, dependent on local SR connectivity. A computational model clarified why spatiotemporal gradients are more detectable in isolated local releases vs. global releases and provides a quantitative framework for understanding intra-SR Ca diffusion.

Conclusions
Intra-SR Ca diffusion is rapid, limiting spatial [Ca]SR gradients during excitation-contraction coupling. Spatiotemporal [Ca]SR gradients are apparent during Ca sparks, and these observations constrain models of dynamic Ca movement inside the SR. This has important implications for myocyte SR Ca handling, synchrony and potentially arrhythmogenic spontaneous contraction.},

To address the structure–function relationship of the dendritic spines, we used two-photon uncaging of glutamate to allow mapping of functional glutamate receptors at the level of the single synapse. Our analyses of the spines of CA1 pyramidal neurons reveal that AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid)-type glutamate receptors are abundant (up to 150/spine) in mushroom spines but sparsely distributed in thin spines and filopodia. The latter may be serving as the structural substrates of the silent synapses that have been proposed to play roles in development and plasticity of synaptic transmission. Our data indicate that distribution of functional AMPA receptors is tightly correlated with spine geometry and that receptor activity is independently regulated at the level of single spines.},

The resulting Ca2+ signals were recorded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 and a laser-scanning confocal microscope in the line-scan mode. In vitro, photolysis of DMNPE-4:Ca2+ produced Ca(2+)-release signals that had comparable amplitudes and time courses in the presence and absence of Mg2+. However, photorelease of Ca2+ from DM-nitrophen was obviated by the presence of Mg2+. In patch-clamped isolated cardiac myocytes, equivalent TPP results were obtained in analogous experiments. Single-photon excitation of DMNPE-4 by Nd:YAG laser flashes produced Na-Ca exchange currents of comparable amplitude in the absence and presence of Mg2+. However, only very small currents were observed in DM-nitrophen solution containing 10 mM Mg2+.

CPVT patients often present bradycardia and sino-atrial node (SAN) dysfunction. However, the mechanism remains unclear. We analyzed SAN function in two CPVT families and in a novel knock-in (KI) mouse model carrying the RyR2R420Q mutation. Humans and KI mice presented slower resting heart rate. Accordingly, the rate of spontaneous intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) transients was slower in KI mouse SAN preparations than in WT, without any significant alteration in the "funny" current (If ). The L-type Ca2+ current was reduced in KI SAN cells in a [Ca2+]i-dependent way, suggesting that bradycardia was due to disrupted crosstalk between the "voltage" and "Ca2+" clock, and the mechanisms of pacemaking was induced by aberrant spontaneous RyR2- dependent Ca2+ release. This finding was consistent with a higher Ca2+ leak during diastolic periods produced by long-lasting Ca2+ sparks in KI SAN cells. Our results uncover a mechanism for the CPVT-causing RyR2 N-terminal mutation R420Q, and they highlight the fact that enhancing the Ca2+ clock may slow the heart rhythm by disturbing the coupling between Ca2+ and voltage clocks.},

We investigated whether this deficit can be traced to nanoscale RyR reorganization. Using super-resolution imaging, we observed dispersion of RyR clusters in cardiomyocytes from post-infarction HF rats, resulting in more numerous, smaller clusters. Functional groupings of RyR clusters which produce Ca 2+ sparks (Ca 2+ release units, CRUs) also became less solid. An increased fraction of small CRUs in HF was linked to augmented ‘silent’ Ca 2+ leak, not visible as sparks. Larger multi-cluster CRUs common in HF also exhibited low fidelity spark generation. When successfully triggered, sparks in failing cells displayed slow kinetics as Ca 2+ spread across dispersed CRUs. During the action potential, these slow sparks protracted and desynchronized the overall Ca 2+ transient. Thus, nanoscale RyR reorganization during HF augments Ca 2+ leak and slows Ca 2+ release kinetics, leading to weakened contraction in this disease.},

	abstract = {In cardiac muscle, a number of posttranslational protein modifications can alter the function of the Ca(2+) release channel of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), also known as the ryanodine receptor (RyR). During every heartbeat RyRs are activated by the Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release mechanism and contribute a large fraction of the Ca(2+) required for contraction. Some of the posttranslational modifications of the RyR are known to affect its gating and Ca(2+) sensitivity. Presently, research in a number of laboratories is focused on RyR phosphorylation, both by PKA and CaMKII, or on RyR modifications caused by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). Both classes of posttranslational modifications are thought to play important roles in the physiological regulation of channel activity, but are also known to provoke abnormal alterations during various diseases. Only recently it was realized that several types of posttranslational modifications are tightly connected and form synergistic (or antagonistic) feed-back loops resulting in additive and potentially detrimental downstream effects. This review summarizes recent findings on such posttranslational modifications, attempts to bridge molecular with cellular findings, and opens a perspective for future work trying to understand the ramifications of crosstalk in these multiple signaling pathways. Clarifying these complex interactions will be important in the development of novel therapeutic approaches, since this may form the foundation for the implementation of multi-pronged treatment regimes in the future.

The two-photon action cross sections of three calcium cages, DM-nitrophen, NP-EGTA, and azid-1, are studied in the range of excitation wavelengths between 700 and 800 nm. Azid-1 has a maximum deltau of approximately 1.4 GM at 700 nm, DM-nitrophen has a maximum deltau of approximately 0.013 GM at 730 nm, and NP-EGTA has no measurable uncaging yield.

Sparks reflect Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via Ca(2+) release channels (ryanodine receptors, RyRs). RyRs are activated by Ca(2+) influx via L-type Ca(2+) channels with a specific probability that may depend on regulatory mechanisms (e.g. beta-adrenergic stimulation) or diseased states (e.g. heart failure). Changes of RyR phosphorylation may be critical for both regulation and impaired function in disease. Using UV flash photolysis of caged Ca(2+) and short applications of caffeine in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes, we found that Ca(2+) release signals on the cellular level were largely governed by global SR content. During beta-adrenergic stimulation resting myocytes exhibited smaller SR Ca(2+) release signals when activated by photolysis (62.3\% of control), resulting from reduced SR Ca(2+) content under these conditions (58.6\% of control). In contrast, local signals triggered with diffraction limited two-photon photolysis displayed the opposite behaviour, exhibiting a larger Ca(2+) release (164\% of control) despite reduced global and local SR Ca(2+) content. This apparent paradox implies changes of RyR open probabilities after beta-adrenergic stimulation, enhancing local regenerativity and reliability of Ca(2+) signalling. Thus, our results underscore the importance of phosphorylation of RyRs (or of a related protein), as a regulatory physiological mechanism that may also provide new therapeutic avenues to recover impaired Ca(2+) signalling during cardiac disease.},

	abstract = {KEY POINTS:Refractoriness of calcium release in heart cells is altered in several disease states, but the physiological mechanisms that regulate this process are incompletely understood. We examined refractoriness of calcium release in mouse ventricular myocytes and investigated how activation of different intracellular signalling pathways influenced this process. We found that refractoriness of calcium release is abbreviated by stimulation of the 'fight-or-flight' response, and that simultaneous activation of multiple intracellular signalling pathways contributes to this response. Data obtained under several conditions at the subcellular, microscopic level were consistent with results obtained at the cellular level. The results provide insight into regulation of cardiac calcium release and how alterations to this process may increase arrhythmia risk under different conditions. ABSTRACT:Time-dependent refractoriness of calcium (Ca(2+)) release in cardiac myocytes is an important factor in determining whether pro-arrhythmic release patterns develop. At the subcellular level of the Ca(2+) spark, recent studies have suggested that recovery of spark amplitude is controlled by local sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) refilling whereas refractoriness of spark triggering depends on both refilling and the sensitivity of the ryanodine receptor (RyR) release channels that produce sparks. Here we studied regulation of Ca(2+) spark refractoriness in mouse ventricular myocytes by examining how β-adrenergic stimulation influenced sequences of Ca(2+) sparks originating from individual RyR clusters. Our protocol allowed us to separately measure recovery of spark amplitude and delays between successive sparks, and data were interpreted quantitatively through simulations with a stochastic mathematical model. We found that, compared with spark sequences measured under control conditions: (1) β-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol (isoprenaline) accelerated spark amplitude recovery and decreased spark-to-spark delays; (2) activating protein kinase A (PKA) with forskolin accelerated amplitude recovery but did not affect spark-to-spark delays; (3) inhibiting PKA with H89 retarded amplitude recovery and increased spark-to-spark delays; (4) preventing phosphorylation of the RyR at serine 2808 with a knock-in mouse prevented the decrease in spark-to-spark delays seen with β-adrenergic stimulation; (5) inhibiting either PKA or Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) during β-adrenergic stimulation prevented the decrease in spark-to-spark delays seen without inhibition. The results suggest that activation of either PKA or CaMKII is sufficient to speed SR refilling, but activation of both kinases appears necessary to observe increased RyR sensitivity. The data provide novel insight into β-adrenergic regulation of Ca(2+) release refractoriness in mouse myocytes.},

	abstract = {Despite extensive research, the mechanisms responsible for the graded nature and early termination of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in cardiac muscle remain poorly understood. Suggested mechanisms include cytosolic Ca2+-dependent inactivation/adaptation and luminal Ca2+-dependent deactivation of the SR Ca2+ release channels/ryanodine receptors (RyRs). To explore the importance of cytosolic versus luminal Ca2+ regulatory mechanisms in controlling CICR, we assessed the impact of intra-SR Ca2+ buffering on global and local Ca2+ release properties of patch-clamped or permeabilized rat ventricular myocytes. Exogenous, low-affinity Ca2+ buffers (5 to 20 mmol/L ADA, citrate or maleate) were introduced into the SR by exposing the cells to "internal" solutions containing the buffers. Enhanced Ca2+ buffering in the SR was confirmed by an increase in the total SR Ca2+ content, as revealed by application of caffeine. At the whole-cell level, intra-SR [Ca2+] buffering dramatically increased the magnitude of Ca2+ transients induced by I(Ca) and deranged the smoothly graded I(Ca)-SR Ca2+ release relationship. The amplitude and time-to-peak of local Ca2+ release events, Ca2+ sparks, as well as the duration of local Ca2+ release fluxes underlying sparks were increased up to 2- to 3-fold. The exogenous Ca2+ buffers in the SR also reduced the frequency of repetitive activity observed at individual release sites in the presence of the RyR activator Imperatoxin A. We conclude that regulation of RyR openings by local intra-SR [Ca2+] is responsible for termination of CICR and for the subsequent restitution behavior of Ca2+ release sites in cardiac muscle.},

	abstract = {Different forms of ventricular arrhythmias have been linked to mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR)2, but the molecular basis for this phenotypic heterogeneity is unknown. We have recently demonstrated that an enhanced sensitivity to luminal Ca(2+) and an increased propensity for spontaneous Ca(2+) release or store-overload-induced Ca(2+) release (SOICR) are common defects of RyR2 mutations associated with catecholaminergic polymorphic or bidirectional ventricular tachycardia. Here, we investigated the properties of a unique RyR2 mutation associated with catecholaminergic idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, A4860G. Single-channel analyses revealed that, unlike all other disease-linked RyR2 mutations characterized previously, the A4860G mutation diminished the response of RyR2 to activation by luminal Ca(2+), but had little effect on the sensitivity of the channel to activation by cytosolic Ca(2+). This specific impact of the A4860G mutation indicates that the luminal Ca(2+) activation of RyR2 is distinct from its cytosolic Ca(2+) activation. Stable, inducible HEK293 cells expressing the A4860G mutant showed caffeine-induced Ca(2+) release but exhibited no SOICR. Importantly, HL-1 cardiac cells transfected with the A4860G mutant displayed attenuated SOICR activity compared with cells transfected with RyR2 WT. These observations provide the first evidence that a loss of luminal Ca(2+) activation and SOICR activity can cause ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. These findings also indicate that although suppressing enhanced SOICR is a promising antiarrhythmic strategy, its oversuppression can also lead to arrhythmias.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:The L-type calcium channel (LCC) plays a crucial role in the electrical remodeling of atrial fibrillation (AF). AF is associated with reduction of L-type calcium current density, due to a transcriptional downregulation of the pore forming alpha(1c)-subunit of LCC. However, it is unclear, whether this current reduction is related to a decrease in channel number or to alterations in channel function. Hence, we performed a single LCC analysis to assess channel gating and function in human AF. METHODS AND RESULTS:We used the cell-attached patch-clamp technique in isolated atrial human cardiomyocytes of 25 patients with sinus rhythm (SR) and 15 patients with chronic AF. Protein expression of the pore-forming alpha(1c)-subunit of LCC was reduced by 40\% in AF. Single channel peak average current was 1.7-fold higher in AF than in SR, due to a 3.1-fold higher open probability of LCC. Since phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is known to preferentially reduce LCC open probability via channel dephosphorylation, we assessed whether PP2A expression or activity is reduced in AF. Okadaic acid, an inhibitor of phosphatases, increased channel open probability in SR, but not in AF. However, Western blot analysis of atrial homogenates of the same patient population revealed unchanged expression of PP2A. CONCLUSIONS:Human AF is characterized by increased single LCC activity, due to an increase of channel open probability. The blunted effect of PP2A on LCC as shown by single channel analysis may be related to a reduction of cytosolic PP2A activity or impaired local interaction between PP2A and LCC in AF.},

	abstract = {beta-Adrenergic receptor (beta-AR) stimulation of cardiac muscle has been proposed to enhance Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through ryanodine receptors (RyRs). However, the anticipated increase in RyR Ca(2+) sensitivity has proven difficult to study in intact cardiomyocytes, due to accompanying alterations in SR Ca(2+) content, inward Ca(2+) current (I(Ca)) and diastolic cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)). Here, we studied whole-cell Ca(2+) release and spontaneous Ca(2+) leak (Ca(2+) sparks) in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes with confocal Ca(2+) imaging before and during beta-AR stimulation by isoproterenol (Iso), but under otherwise nearly identical experimental conditions. The extent of SR Ca(2+) loading was controlled under whole-cell voltage-clamp conditions. UV flash-induced uncaging of Ca(2+) from DM-nitrophen was employed as an invariant trigger for whole-cell Ca(2+) release. At matched SR Ca(2+) content, we found that Iso enhanced the spatiotemporal coherence of whole-cell Ca(2+) release, evident from spatially intercorrelated release and accelerated release kinetics that resulted in moderately (20\%) increased release amplitude. This may arise from higher RyR Ca(2+) sensitivity, and was also reflected in spontaneous SR Ca(2+) leak. At comparable SR Ca(2+) content and cytosolic [Ca(2+)](i), we observed an approximately 4-fold increase in Ca(2+) spark frequency in Iso that also appeared in quiescent cells within 2 min without increased SR Ca(2+) content. This was likely to have been mediated by Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII), rather than cAMP dependent protein kinase (PKA). We conclude that Iso increases the propensity of RyRs to open, both in response to rapid elevations of [Ca(2+)](i) and at diastolic [Ca(2+)](i). While this could be beneficial in enhancing and synchronizing systolic whole-cell SR Ca(2+) release, the same behaviour could also be proarrhythmogenic during diastole.},

Automated detection methods have been developed to quickly and objectively distinguish potential sparks from noise artifacts. However, previously described algorithms are not suited to the reliable detection of sparks in images where the local baseline fluorescence and noise properties can vary significantly, and risk introducing additional bias when applied to such data sets. Here, we describe a new, conceptually straightforward approach to spark detection in linescans that addresses this issue by combining variance stabilization with local baseline subtraction. We also show that in addition to greatly increasing the range of images in which sparks can be automatically detected, the use of a more accurate noise model enables our algorithm to achieve similar detection sensitivities with fewer false positives than previous approaches when applied both to synthetic and experimental data sets. We propose, therefore, that it might be a useful tool for improving the reliability and objectivity of spark analysis in general, and describe how it might be further optimized for specific applications.},

Spontaneous diastolic Ca(2+) release (DCR) can induce arrhythmogenic plasma membrane depolarizations, although the mechanism responsible for DCR synchronization among adjacent myocytes required for ectopic activity remains unclear. We investigated the synchronization mechanism(s) of DCR underlying untimely action potentials and diastolic contractions (DCs) in a catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia mouse model with a mutation in cardiac calsequestrin. We used a combination of different approaches including single ryanodine receptor channel recording, optical imaging (Ca(2+) and membrane potential), and contractile force measurements in ventricular myocytes and intact cardiac muscles. We demonstrate that DCR occurs in a temporally and spatially uniform manner in both myocytes and intact myocardial tissue isolated from cardiac calsequestrin mutation mice. Such synchronized DCR events give rise to triggered electrical activity that results in synchronous DCs in the myocardium. Importantly, we establish that synchronization of DCR is a result of a combination of abbreviated ryanodine receptor channel refractoriness and the preceding synchronous stimulated Ca(2+) release/reuptake dynamics. Our study reveals how aberrant DCR events can become synchronized in the intact myocardium, leading to triggered activity and the resultant DCs in the settings of a cardiac rhythm disorder.},

Cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR) gating in rats and sheep was recorded at physiological Ca(2+), Mg(2+), and ATP levels and incorporated into a 3D model of the cardiac dyad, which reproduced the time course of Ca(2+) sparks, Ca(2+) blinks, and Ca(2+) spark restitution. The termination of CICR by induction decay in the model principally arose from the steep Ca(2+) dependence of RyR closed time, with the measured sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) lumen Ca(2+) dependence of RyR gating making almost no contribution. The start of CICR termination was strongly dependent on the extent of local depletion of junctional SR Ca(2+), as well as the time course of local Ca(2+) gradients within the junctional space. Reducing the dimensions of the dyad junction reduced Ca(2+) spark amplitude by reducing the strength of regenerative feedback within CICR. A refractory period for Ca(2+) spark initiation and subsequent Ca(2+) spark amplitude restitution arose from 1), the extent to which the regenerative phase of CICR can be supported by the partially depleted junctional SR, and 2), the availability of releasable Ca(2+) in the junctional SR. The physical organization of RyRs within the junctional space had minimal effects on Ca(2+) spark amplitude when more than nine RyRs were present. Spark amplitude had a nonlinear dependence on RyR single-channel Ca(2+) flux, and was approximately halved by reducing the flux from 0.6 to 0.2 pA. Although rat and sheep RyRs had quite different Ca(2+) sensitivities, Ca(2+) spark amplitude was hardly affected. This suggests that moderate changes in RyR gating by second-messenger systems will principally alter the spatiotemporal properties of SR release, with smaller effects on the amount released.},

Rat hearts were perfused with increasing concentrations of the beta-agonist isoproterenol in the absence and the presence of CaMKII inhibition. CaMKII was inhibited either by preventing the Ca(2+) influx to the cell by low [Ca](o) plus nifedipine or by the specific inhibitor KN-93. We immunodetected RyR2 phosphorylated at Ser2809 (PKA and putative CaMKII site) and at Ser2815 (CaMKII site) and measured [(3)H]-ryanodine binding and fast Ca(2+) release kinetics in sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) vesicles. SR vesicles were isolated in conditions that preserved the phosphorylation levels achieved in the intact heart and were actively and equally loaded with Ca(2+). Our results demonstrated that Ser2809 and Ser2815 of RyR2 were dose-dependently phosphorylated under betaAR stimulation by PKA and CaMKII, respectively. The isoproterenol-induced increase in the phosphorylation of Ser2815 site was prevented by the PKA inhibitor H-89 and mimicked by forskolin. CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of RyR2 (but not PKA-dependent phosphorylation) was responsible for the beta-induced increase in the channel activity as indicated by the enhancement of the [(3)H]-ryanodine binding and the velocity of fast SR Ca(2+) release. The present results show for the first time a dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of Ser2815 of RyR2 through the PKA-dependent activation of CaMKII and a predominant role of CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of RyR2, over that of PKA-dependent phosphorylation, on SR-Ca(2+) release during betaAR stimulation.},

	abstract = {Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release is a general mechanism that most cells use to amplify Ca2+ signals. In heart cells, this mechanism is operated between voltage-gated L-type Ca2+ channels (LCCs) in the plasma membrane and Ca2+ release channels, commonly known as ryanodine receptors, in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The Ca2+ influx through LCCs traverses a cleft of roughly 12 nm formed by the cell surface and the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane, and activates adjacent ryanodine receptors to release Ca2+ in the form of Ca2+ sparks. Here we determine the kinetics, fidelity and stoichiometry of coupling between LCCs and ryanodine receptors. We show that the local Ca2+ signal produced by a single opening of an LCC, named a 'Ca2+ sparklet', can trigger about 4-6 ryanodine receptors to generate a Ca2+ spark. The coupling between LCCs and ryanodine receptors is stochastic, as judged by the exponential distribution of the coupling latency. The fraction of sparklets that successfully triggers a spark is less than unity and declines in a use-dependent manner. This optical analysis of single-channel communication affords a powerful means for elucidating Ca2+-signalling mechanisms at the molecular level.},

	abstract = {Calsequestrin, the only known protein with cyclical storage and supply of calcium as main role, is proposed to have other functions, which remain unproven. Voluntary movement and the heart beat require this calcium flow to be massive and fast. How does calsequestrin do it? To bind large amounts of calcium in vitro, calsequestrin must polymerize and then depolymerize to release it. Does this rule apply inside the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of a working cell? We answered using fluorescently tagged calsequestrin expressed in muscles of mice. By FRAP and imaging we monitored mobility of calsequestrin as [Ca2+] in the SR–measured with a calsequestrin-fused biosensor–was lowered. We found that calsequestrin is polymerized within the SR at rest and that it depolymerized as [Ca2+] went down: fully when calcium depletion was maximal (a condition achieved with an SR calcium channel opening drug) and partially when depletion was limited (a condition imposed by fatiguing stimulation, long-lasting depolarization, or low drug concentrations). With fluorescence and electron microscopic imaging we demonstrated massive movements of calsequestrin accompanied by drastic morphological SR changes in fully depleted cells. When cells were partially depleted no remodeling was found. The present results support the proposed role of calsequestrin in termination of calcium release by conformationally inducing closure of SR channels. A channel closing switch operated by calsequestrin depolymerization will limit depletion, thereby preventing full disassembly of the polymeric calsequestrin network and catastrophic structural changes in the SR.},

We propose a method to approach this problem by trying to estimate a function f that is positive on S and negative on the complement. The functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector in an associated feature space. The expansion coefficients are found by solving a quadratic programming problem, which we do by carrying out sequential optimization over pairs of input patterns. We also provide a theoretical analysis of the statistical performance of our algorithm. The algorithm is a natural extension of the support vector algorithm to the case of unlabeled data.},

Saturating concentrations (10 µmol/L) of either FKBP12 or 12.6 significantly reduced the frequency, spread, amplitude and Ca2+ spark mass relative to control, while the tomograms revealed both proteins shifted the tetramers into a largely side-by-side configuration. Phosphorylation of immunophilin-saturated RyR2 resulted in structural and functional changes largely comparable to phosphorylation alone. dSTORM images of myocyte surfaces demonstrated that both FKBP12 and 12.6 significantly reduced RyR2 cluster sizes, while phosphorylation, even of immunophilin-saturated RyR2, increased them. We conclude that both RyR2 cluster size and the arrangement of tetramers within clusters is dynamic and respond to changes in the cellular environment.

Synthesized bis(styryl)benzene derivatives with donor-pi-donor, donor-acceptor-donor, and acceptor-donor-acceptor structural motifs exhibit exceptionally large values of delta, up to about 400 times that of trans-stilbene. Quantum chemical calculations performed on these molecules indicate that substantial symmetric charge redistribution occurs upon excitation and provide delta values in good agreement with experimental values. The combination of large delta and high fluorescence quantum yield or triplet yield exhibited by molecules developed here offers potential for unprecedented brightness in two-photon fluorescent imaging or enhanced photosensitivity in two-photon sensitization, respectively.},

In contrast, this paper presents a method that selects critical patterns deemed to carry essential information applicable to train those types of classifiers which require spatial information of the training data set. Critical patterns include those edge patterns that define the boundary and those border patterns that separate classes. The proposed method selects patterns from a new perspective, primarily based on their location in input space. It determines class edge patterns with the assistance of the approximated tangent hyperplane of a class surface. It also identifies border patterns between classes using local probability. The proposed method is evaluated on benchmark problems using popular classifiers, including multilayer perceptrons, radial basis functions, support vector machines, and nearest neighbors. The proposed approach is also compared with four state-of-the-art approaches and it is shown to provide similar but more consistent accuracy from a reduced data set. Experimental results demonstrate that it selects patterns sufficient to represent class boundary and to preserve the decision surface.},

	abstract = {KEY POINTS:Using 3D direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), we developed novel approaches to quantitatively describe the nanoscale, 3D organization of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in cardiomyocytes. Complex arrangements of RyR clusters were observed in 3D space, both at the cell surface and within the cell interior, with allocation to dyadic and non-dyadic pools. 3D imaging importantly allowed discernment of clusters overlapping in the z-axis, for which detection was obscured by conventional 2D imaging techniques. Thus, RyR clusters were found to be significantly smaller than previous 2D estimates. Ca2+ release units (CRUs), i.e. functional groupings of neighbouring RyR clusters, were similarly observed to be smaller than earlier reports. Internal CRUs contained more RyRs in more clusters than CRUs on the cell surface, and yielded longer duration Ca2+ sparks. ABSTRACT:Cardiomyocyte contraction is dependent on Ca2+ release from ryanodine receptors (RyRs). However, the precise localization of RyRs remains unknown, due to shortcomings of imaging techniques which are diffraction limited or restricted to 2D. We aimed to determine the 3D nanoscale organization of RyRs in rat cardiomyocytes by employing direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM) with phase ramp technology. Initial observations at the cell surface showed an undulating organization of RyR clusters, resulting in their frequent overlap in the z-axis and obscured detection by 2D techniques. Non-overlapping clusters were imaged to create a calibration curve for estimating RyR number based on recorded fluorescence blinks. Employing this method at the cell surface and interior revealed smaller RyR clusters than 2D estimates, as erroneous merging of axially aligned RyRs was circumvented. Functional groupings of RyR clusters (Ca2+ release units, CRUs), contained an average of 18 and 23 RyRs at the surface and interior, respectively, although half of all CRUs contained only a single 'rogue' RyR. Internal CRUs were more tightly packed along z-lines than surface CRUs, contained larger and more numerous RyR clusters, and constituted ∼75\% of the roughly 1 million RyRs present in an average cardiomyocyte. This complex internal 3D geometry was underscored by correlative imaging of RyRs and t-tubules, which enabled quantification of dyadic and non-dyadic RyR populations. Mirroring differences in CRU size and complexity, Ca2+ sparks originating from internal CRUs were of longer duration than those at the surface. These data provide novel, nanoscale insight into RyR organization and function across cardiomyocytes.},

Within the amino terminal half of the molecule the locations of helices predicted by a number of methods agree moderately well with the observed structure, however within the carboxyl half of the molecule the overall agreement is poor. For eleven different helix predictions, the coefficients giving the correlation between prediction and observation range from 0.14 to 0.42. The accuracy of the predictions for both beta-sheet regions and for turns are generally lower than for the helices, and in a number of instances the agreement between prediction and observation is no better than would be expected for a random selection of residues. The structural predictions for T4 phage lysozyme are much less successful than was the case for adenylate kinase (Schulz et al. (1974) Nature 250, 140-142). No one method of prediction is clearly superior to all others, and although empirical predictions based on larger numbers of known protein structure tend to be more accurate than those based on a limited sample, the improvement in accuracy is not dramatic, suggesting that the accuracy of current empirical predictive methods will not be substantially increased simply by the inclusion of more data from additional protein structure determinations.},

In this review, we describe methods for the isolation of adult and neonatal ventricular myocytes from rat and mouse heart. This discussion outlines general principles for the beginner, but also provides detailed specific protocols and advice for common caveats. We additionally review methods for short-term myocyte culture, with particular attention given to the importance of substrate and media selection, and describe time-dependent alterations in myocyte physiology that should be anticipated.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:To evaluate binary classifications and their confusion matrices, scientific researchers can employ several statistical rates, accordingly to the goal of the experiment they are investigating. Despite being a crucial issue in machine learning, no widespread consensus has been reached on a unified elective chosen measure yet. Accuracy and F1 score computed on confusion matrices have been (and still are) among the most popular adopted metrics in binary classification tasks. However, these statistical measures can dangerously show overoptimistic inflated results, especially on imbalanced datasets. RESULTS:The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), instead, is a more reliable statistical rate which produces a high score only if the prediction obtained good results in all of the four confusion matrix categories (true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives), proportionally both to the size of positive elements and the size of negative elements in the dataset. CONCLUSIONS:In this article, we show how MCC produces a more informative and truthful score in evaluating binary classifications than accuracy and F1 score, by first explaining the mathematical properties, and then the asset of MCC in six synthetic use cases and in a real genomics scenario. We believe that the Matthews correlation coefficient should be preferred to accuracy and F1 score in evaluating binary classification tasks by all scientific communities.},

	abstract = {Photochemical uncaging of bio-active molecules was introduced in 1977, but since then, there has been no substantial improvement in the properties of generic caging chromophores. We have developed a new chromophore, nitrodibenzofuran (NDBF) for ultra-efficient uncaging of second messengers inside cells. Photolysis of a NDBF derivative of EGTA (caged calcium) is about 16-160 times more efficient than photolysis of the most widely used caged compounds (the quantum yield of photolysis is 0.7 and the extinction coefficient is 18,400 M(-1) cm(-1)). Ultraviolet (UV)-laser photolysis of NDBF-EGTA:Ca(2+) rapidly released Ca(2+) (rate of 20,000 s(-1)) and initiated contraction of skinned guinea pig cardiac muscle. NDBF-EGTA has a two-photon cross-section of approximately 0.6 GM and two-photon photolysis induced localized Ca(2+)-induced Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic recticulum of intact cardiac myocytes. Thus, the NDBF chromophore has great promise as a generic and photochemically efficient protecting group for both one- and two-photon uncaging in living cells.},

	abstract = {Two-photon excitation fluorescence imaging provides thin optical sections from deep within thick, scattering specimens by way of restricting fluorophore excitation (and thus emission) to the focal plane of the microscope. Spatial confinement of two-photon excitation gives rise to several advantages over single-photon confocal microscopy. First, penetration depth of the excitation beam is increased. Second, because out-of-focus fluorescence is never generated, no pinhole is necessary in the detection path of the microscope, resulting in increased fluorescence collection efficiency. Third, two-photon excitation markedly reduces overall photobleaching and photodamage, resulting in extended viability of biological specimens during long-term imaging. Finally, localized excitation can be used for photolysis of caged compounds in femtoliter volumes and for diffusion measurements by two-photon fluorescence photobleaching recovery. This review aims to provide an overview of the use of two-photon excitation microscopy. Selected applications of this technique will illustrate its excellent suitability to assess cellular and subcellular events in intact, strongly scattering tissue. In particular, its capability to resolve differences in calcium dynamics between individual cardiomyocytes deep within intact, buffer-perfused hearts is demonstrated. Potential applications of two-photon laser scanning microscopy as applied to integrative cardiac physiology are pointed out.},

This process is seen as Ca(2+) sparks, which reflect the concerted gating of groups of RyRs in the dyad, a specialised junctional signalling domain between the SR and surface membrane. However, the mechanism(s) responsible for the termination of regenerative CICR during the evolution of Ca(2+) sparks remain uncertain. Rat cardiac RyR gating was recorded at physiological Ca(2+), Mg(2+) and ATP levels and incorporated into a 3D model of the cardiac dyad which reproduced the time-course of Ca(2+) sparks, Ca(2+) blinks and Ca(2+) spark restitution. Model CICR termination was robust, relatively insensitive to the number of dyadic RyRs and automatic. This emergent behaviour arose from the rapid development and dissolution of nanoscopic Ca(2+) gradients within the dyad. These simulations show that CICR does not require intrinsic inactivation or SR calcium sensing mechanisms for stability and cessation of regeneration that arises from local control at the molecular scale via a process we call 'induction decay'.},

The two members, ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP Rs), are evolutionarily related and are both activated by cytosolic Ca21. They share a common architecture, bu3t RyRs have evolved additional modules in the cytosolic region. Their massive size allows for the regulation by tens of proteins and small molecules, which can affect the opening and closing of the channels. In addition to Ca21, other major triggers include IP3 for the IP3Rs and depolarization of the plasma membrane for a particular RyR subtype expressed in skeletal muscle. Their size has made them popular targets for study via electron microscopic methods, with current structures culminating near 3 Å. The available structures have provided many new mechanistic insights into the binding of auxiliary proteins and small molecules, how these can regulate channel opening, and the mechanisms of disease-associated mutations. They also help scrutinize previously proposed binding sites, as some of these are now incompatible with the structures. Many questions remain around the structural effects of posttranslational modiﬁcations, additional binding partners, and the higher order complexes these channels can make in situ. This review summarizes our current knowledge about the structures of Ca21-release channels and how this informs on their function.},

We also discuss the within-between RE model, sometimes misleadingly labelled a ‘hybrid’ model, showing that it is the most general of the three, with all the strengths of the other two. As such, and because it allows for important extensions—notably random slopes—we argue it should be used (as a starting point at least) in all multilevel analyses. We develop the argument through simulations, evaluating how these models cope with some likely mis-specifications. These simulations reveal that (1) failing to include random slopes can generate anticonservative standard errors, and (2) assuming random intercepts are Normally distributed, when they are not, introduces only modest biases. These results strengthen the case for the use of, and need for, these models.},

	abstract = {Various cardio-active stimuli, including endothelin-1 (ET-1), exhibit potent arrhythmogenicity, but the underlying cellular mechanisms of their actions are largely unclear. We used isolated rat atrial myocytes and related changes in their subcellular Ca2+ signalling to the ability of various stimuli to induce diastolic, premature extra Ca2+ transients (ECTs). For this, we recorded global and spatially resolved Ca2+ signals in indo-1- and fluo-4-loaded atrial myocytes during electrical pacing. ET-1 exhibited a higher arrhythmogenicity (arrhythmogenic index; ratio of number of ECTs over fold-increase in Ca2+ response, 8.60; n= 8 cells) when compared with concentrations of cardiac glycosides (arrhythmogenic index, 4.10; n= 8 cells) or the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (arrhythmogenic index, 0.11; n= 6 cells) that gave similar increases in the global Ca2+ responses. Seventy-five percent of the ET-1-induced arrhythmogenic Ca2+ transients were accompanied by premature action potentials, while for digoxin this proportion was 25 \%. The β-adrenergic agonist failed to elicit a significant number of ECTs. Direct activation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptors with a membrane-permeable InsP3 ester (InsP3 BM) mimicked the effect of ET-1 (arrhythmogenic index, 14.70; n= 6 cells). Inhibition of InsP3 receptors using 2 μM 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, which did not display any effects on Ca2+ signalling under control conditions, specifically suppressed the arrhythmogenic action of ET-1 and InsP3 BM. Immunocytochemistry indicated a co-localisation of peripheral, junctional ryanodine receptors with InsP3Rs. Thus, the pronounced arrhythmogenic potency of ET-1 is due to the spatially specific recruitment of Ca2+ sparks by subsarcolemmal InsP3Rs. Summation of such sparks efficiently generates delayed afterdepolarisations that trigger premature action potentials. We conclude that the particular spatial profile of cellular Ca2+ signals is a major, previously unrecognised, determinant for arrhythmogenic potency and that the InsP3 signalling cassette might therefore be a promising new target for understanding and managing atrial arrhythmia.},

	abstract = {Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3)-dependent Ca2+ release represents the major Ca2+ mobilizing pathway responsible for diverse functions in non-excitable cells. In the heart, however, its role is largely unknown or controversial. In intact cat atrial myocytes, endothelin (ET-1) increased basal [Ca2+]i levels, enhanced action potential-evoked [Ca2+]i transients, caused [Ca2+]i transients with alternating amplitudes (Ca2+ alternans), and facilitated spontaneous Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the form of Ca2+ sparks and arrhythmogenic Ca2+ waves. These effects were prevented by the IP3 receptor (IP3R) blocker aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), suggesting the involvement of IP3-dependent SR Ca2+ release. In saponin-permeabilized myocytes IP3 and the more potent IP3R agonist adenophostin increased basal [Ca2+]i and the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks. In the presence of tetracaine to eliminate Ca2+ release from ryanodine receptor (RyR) SR Ca2+ release channels, IP3 and adenophostin triggered unique elementary, non-propagating IP3R-dependent Ca2+ release events with amplitudes and kinetics that were distinctly different from classical RyR-dependent Ca2+ sparks. The effects of IP3 and adenophostin were prevented by heparin and 2-APB. The data suggest that IP3-dependent Ca2+ release increases [Ca2+]i in the vicinity of RyRs and thus facilitates Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release during excitation–contraction coupling. It is concluded that in the adult mammalian atrium IP3-dependent Ca2+ release enhances atrial Ca2+ signalling and exerts a positive inotropic effect. In addition, by facilitating Ca2+ release, IP3 may also be an important component in the development of Ca2+-mediated atrial arrhythmias.},

	abstract = {We examined the regulation of calcium signalling in atrial cardiomyocytes during excitation-contraction coupling, and how changes in the distribution of calcium impacts on contractility. Under control conditions, calcium transients originated in subsarcolemmal locations and showed local regeneration through activation of calcium-induced calcium release from ryanodine receptors. Despite functional ryanodine receptors being expressed at regular (∼2 μm) intervals throughout atrial myocytes, the subsarcolemmal calcium signal did not spread in a fully regenerative manner through the interior of a cell. Rather, there was a diminishing centripetal propagation of calcium. The lack of regeneration was due to mitochondria and SERCA pumps preventing the inward movement of calcium. Inhibiting these calcium buffering mechanisms allowed the globalisation of action potential-evoked responses. In addition, physiological positive inotropic agents, such as endothelin-1 and β-adrenergic agonists, as well as enhanced calcium current, calcium store loading and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate infusion also led to regenerative global responses. The consequence of globalising calcium signals was a significant increase in cellular contraction. These data indicate how calcium signals and their consequences are determined by the interplay of multiple subcellular calcium management systems.},

The major action of IP(3), which is hydrophilic and thus translocates from the membrane into the cytoplasm, is to induce Ca(2+) release from endogenous stores through IP(3) receptors (IP(3)Rs). Cardiac excitation-contraction coupling relies largely on ryanodine receptor (RyR)-induced Ca(2+) release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Myocytes express a significantly larger number of RyRs compared to IP(3)Rs ({\textasciitilde}100:1), and furthermore they experience substantial fluxes of Ca(2+) with each heartbeat. Therefore, the role of IP(3) and IP(3)-mediated Ca(2+) signaling in cardiac myocytes has long been enigmatic. Recent evidence, however, indicates that despite their paucity cardiac IP(3)Rs may play crucial roles in regulating diverse cardiac functions. Strategic localization of IP(3)Rs in cytoplasmic compartments and the nucleus enables them to participate in subsarcolemmal, bulk cytoplasmic and nuclear Ca(2+) signaling in embryonic stem cell-derived and neonatal cardiomyocytes, and in adult cardiac myocytes from the atria and ventricles. Intriguingly, expression of both IP(3)Rs and membrane receptors that couple to PLC/IP(3) signaling is altered in cardiac disease such as atrial fibrillation or heart failure, suggesting the involvement of IP(3) signaling in the pathology of these diseases. Thus, IP(3) exerts important physiological and pathological functions in the heart, ranging from the regulation of pacemaking, excitation-contraction and excitation-transcription coupling to the initiation and/or progression of arrhythmias, hypertrophy and heart failure.},

	abstract = {Rationale
Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) is a second messenger that regulates intracellular Ca2+ release through IP3 receptors located in the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum of cardiac myocytes. Many prohypertrophic G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling events lead to IP3 liberation, although its importance in transducing the hypertrophic response has not been established in vivo.

Objective
Here we generated conditional, heart-specific transgenic mice with both gain- and loss-of-function for IP3 receptor signaling to examine its hypertrophic growth effects following pathologic and physiologic stimulation.

Methods and Results
Overexpression of the mouse type-2 IP3 receptor (IP3R2) in the heart generated mild baseline cardiac hypertrophy at 3 months of age. Isolated myocytes from overexpressing lines showed increased Ca2+ transients and arrhythmias in response to endothelin-1 stimulation. While low levels of IP3R2 overexpression failed to augment/synergize cardiac hypertrophy following 2 weeks of pressure overload stimulation, it did enhance hypertrophy following 2 weeks of isoproterenol infusion, in response to Gαq overexpression, and/or in response to exercise stimulation. To inhibit IP3 signaling in vivo we generated transgenic mice expressing an IP3 chelating protein (IP3-sponge). IP3-sponge transgenic mice abrogated cardiac hypertrophy in response to isoproterenol and angiotensin II infusion, but not pressure overload stimulation. Mechanistically, IP3R2-enhanced cardiac hypertrophy following isoproterenol infusion was significantly reduced in the calcineurin-Aβ null background.

Conclusion
These results indicate that IP3-mediated Ca2+ release plays a central role in regulating cardiac hypertrophy downstream of GPCR signaling, in part, through a calcineurin-dependent mechanism.},

Abstract Augmented inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R) function has been linked to a variety of cardiac pathologies, including cardiac arrhythmia. The contribution of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-induced Ca2+ release (IP3ICR) in excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) under physiological conditions, as well as under cellular remodelling, remains controversial. Here we test the hypothesis that local IP3ICR directly affects ryanodine receptor (RyR) function and subsequent Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in atrial myocytes. IP3ICR was evoked by UV-flash photolysis of caged InsP3 under whole-cell configuration of the voltage-clamp technique in atrial myocytes isolated from C57/BL6 mice. Photolytic release of InsP3 was accompanied by a significant increase in the Ca2+ release event frequency (4.14 ± 0.72 vs. 6.20 ± 0.76 events (100 μm)−1 s−1). These individual photolytically triggered Ca2+ release events were identified as Ca2+ sparks, which originated from RyR openings. This was verified by Ca2+ spark analysis and pharmacological separation between RyR and InsP3R-dependent sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-Ca2+ release (2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, xestospongin C, tetracaine). Significant SR-Ca2+ flux but eventless SR-Ca2+ release through InsP3R were characterized using SR-Ca2+ leak/SR-Ca2+ load measurements. These results strongly support the idea that IP3ICR can effectively modulate RyR openings and Ca2+ spark probability. We conclude that eventless and highly efficient InsP3-dependent SR-Ca2+ flux is the main mechanism of functional cross-talk between InsP3Rs and RyRs, which may be an important factor in the modulation of ECC sensitivity.},

The functional interaction between the two major Ca2+ release mechanisms in cardiomyocytes, Ca2+ release mediated by ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) and InsP3-induced intracellular Ca2+ release (IP3ICR) remains enigmatic. We aimed at identifying characterizing local IP3ICR events, and elucidating functional local crosstalk mechanisms between cardiac InsP3R2s and RyR2s under conditions of enhanced cardiac specific InsP3R2 activity.Using confocal imaging and two-dimensional spark analysis, we demonstrate in atrial myocytes (mouse model cardiac specific overexpressing InsP3R2s) that local Ca2+ release through InsP3Rs (Ca2+ puff) directly activates RyRs and triggers elementary Ca2+ release events (Ca2+ sparks). In the presence of increased intracellular InsP3 concentrations IP3ICR can modulate RyRs openings and Ca2+ spark probability. We show as well that IP3ICR remains under local control of Ca2+ release through RyRs.Our results support the concept of bidirectional interaction between RyRs and InsP3Rs (i.e. Ca2+ sparks and Ca2+ puffs) in atrial myocytes. We conclude that highly efficient InsP3 dependent SR-Ca2+ flux constitute the main mechanism of functional crosstalk between InsP3Rs and RyRs resulting in more Ca2+ sensitized RyRs to trigger subsequent Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release activation. In this way, bidirectional local interaction of both SR-Ca2+ release channels may contribute to the shaping of global Ca2+ transients and thereby to contractility in cardiac myocytes.},

Although cardiac IP3R2 function has been in the focus of research for some time, a detailed understanding of its potential role in ventricular myocyte excitation–contraction coupling under pathophysiological conditions remains elusive. The present study focuses on mechanisms of IP3R2-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-Ca2+ release in ventricular excitation–contraction coupling under IP3R2-overexpressing conditions by studying intracellular Ca2+ events. We report that, upon IP3R2 overexpression in ventricular myocytes, IP3-induced Ca2+ release (IP3ICR) modulates the SR-Ca2+ content via “eventless” SR-Ca2+ release, affecting the global SR-Ca2+ leak. Thus, IP3R2 activation could act as a SR-Ca2+ gateway mechanism to escape ominous SR-Ca2+ overload. Our approach unmasks a so far unrecognized mechanism by which “eventless” IP3ICR plays a protective role against ventricular Ca2+-dependent arrhythmogenicity. Abstract Augmented inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor (IP3R2) function has been linked to a variety of cardiac pathologies including cardiac arrhythmias. The functional role of IP3-induced Ca2+ release (IP3ICR) within ventricular excitation–contraction coupling (ECC) remains elusive. As part of pathophysiological cellular remodelling, IP3R2s are overexpressed and have been repeatedly linked to enhanced Ca2+-dependent arrhythmogenicity. In this study we test the hypothesis that an opposite scenario might be plausible in which IP3ICR is part of an ECC protecting mechanism, resulting in a Ca2+-dependent anti-arrhythmogenic response on the cellular scale. IP3R2 activation was triggered via endothelin-1 or IP3-salt application in single ventricular myocytes from a cardiac-specific IP3R type 2 overexpressing mouse model. Upon IP3R2 overexpression, IP3R activation reduced Ca2+-wave occurrence (46 vs. 21.72\%; P {\textless} 0.001) while its block increased SR-Ca2+ content (∼29.4\% 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate, ∼16.4\% xestospongin C; P {\textless} 0.001), suggesting an active role of IP3ICR in SR-Ca2+ content regulation and anti-arrhythmogenic function. Pharmacological separation of ryanodine receptor RyR2 and IP3R2 functions and two-dimensional Ca2+ event analysis failed to identify local IP3ICR events (Ca2+ puffs). SR-Ca2+ leak measurements revealed that under pathophysiological conditions, “eventless” SR-Ca2+ efflux via enhanced IP3ICR maintains the SR-Ca2+ content below Ca2+ spark threshold, preventing aberrant SR-Ca2+ release and resulting in a protective mechanism against SR-Ca2+ overload and arrhythmias. Our results support a so far unrecognized modulatory mechanism in ventricular myocytes working in an anti-arrhythmogenic fashion.},

	abstract = {The shortening of sarcomeres that co-ordinates the pump function of the heart is stimulated by electrically-mediated increases in [Ca2+]. This process of excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) is subject to modulation by neurohormonal mediators that tune the output of the heart to meet the needs of the organism. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent modulator of cardiac function with effects on contraction amplitude, chronotropy and automaticity. The actions of ET-1 are evident during normal adaptive physiological responses and increased under pathophysiological conditions, such as following myocardial infarction and during heart failure, where ET-1 levels are elevated. In myocytes, ET-1 acts through ETA- or ETB-G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although well studied in atrial myocytes, the influence and mechanisms of action of ET-1 upon ECC in ventricular myocytes are not fully resolved. We show in rat ventricular myocytes that ET-1 elicits a biphasic effect on fractional shortening (initial transient negative and sustained positive inotropy) and increases the peak amplitude of systolic Ca2+ transients in adult rat ventricular myocytes. The negative inotropic phase was ETB receptor-dependent, whereas the positive inotropic response and increase in peak amplitude of systolic Ca2+ transients required ETA receptor engagement. Both effects of ET-1 required phospholipase C (PLC)-activity, although distinct signalling pathways downstream of PLC elicited the effects of each ET receptor. The negative inotropic response involved inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) signalling and protein kinase C epsilon (PKCε). The positive inotropic action and the enhancement in Ca2+ transient amplitude induced by ET-1 were independent of InsP3 signalling, but suppressed by PKCε. Serine 302 in cardiac myosin binding protein-C was identified as a PKCε substrate that when phosphorylated contributed to the suppression of contraction and Ca2+ transients by PKCε following ET-1 stimulation. Thus, our data provide a new role and mechanism of action for InsP3 and PKCε in mediating the negative inotropic response and in restraining the positive inotropy and enhancement in Ca2+ transients following ET-1 stimulation.},

An increased concentration of dopamine in the water subphase resulted in an increase in the area per calix[4]resorcinarene molecule, an increase in the collapse pressure, and a shift in the monolayer phase transitions from the gaseous to the liquid state and from the liquid to the solid state toward higher molecular areas. A contactless method of recording MDCs enabled the monitoring of changes in the charge state of the monolayer-constituting molecules and the determination of a relationship between the phase state of the monolayer and the structural transitions of calix[4]resorcinarene. The changes of the MDC recordings started already in the gaseous state of the monolayer. On the basis of MDC values, we determined the normal component of the dipole moment of calix[4]resorcinarene, as well as that of its complex with dopamine. The dipole moment reached a maximum value of 1040 mD in the region of the phase transition from the liquid to the solid state of the monolayer. The results obtained suggest that the binding of dopamine with calix[4]resorcinarene depends on the orientation of the calixarene molecules in the monolayer. The calix[4]resorcinarene−dopamine interactions were also quantified in terms of the excess of Gibbs free energy, thereby allowing the evaluation of the energy of the calix [4]resorcinarene−dopamine bond, which was in the range from 1.95 to 8.54 kJ/mol depending on the surface pressure. This value implies weak interactions between these molecules.},

Abstract In mammalian cardiac myocytes, the elementary calcium releases triggered by step voltage stimuli manifest either as solitary or as twin spikes that vary widely in kinetics and amplitude for unknown reasons. Here we examined the variability of calcium spikes measured using line-scanning confocal microscopy in patch-clamped rat ventricular myocytes. Amplitude distributions of the single and of the first of twin spikes were broader than those of the second spikes. All could be best approximated by a sum of a few elementary Gaussian probability distribution functions. The latency distributions of the single and the first spikes were identical, much shorter and less variable than those of the second spikes. The multimodal distribution of spike amplitudes and the probability of occurrence of twin spikes were stochastically congruent with activation of only a few of the many RyR2 channels present in the release site cluster. The occurrence of twin release events was rare due to refractoriness of release, induced with a probability proportional to the number of RyR2s activated in the primary release event. We conclude that the variability of the elementary calcium release events supports a calcium signalling mechanism that arises from stochastics of RyR2 gating and from inactivation of local origin.},

Statistical analysis was used to evaluate the performance of spike fitting algorithms. The procedure was optimized for reliable estimation of calcium spike parameters and for dismissal of false events. A new algorithm was introduced that corrects the acquisition time of pixels in line-scan images that is in error due to sequential acquisition of individual pixels along the space coordinate. New software was developed in Matlab and provided for general use. It allows interactive dissection of temporal profiles of calcium spikes from x-t images, their fitting with predefined function(s) and acceptance of results on statistical grounds, thus allowing efficient analysis and reliable description of calcium signaling in cardiac myocytes down to the in situ function of ryanodine receptors.},

	abstract = {Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle disease with severe cardiac complications. It is believed that cellular oxidative stress and augmented Ca2+ signaling drives the development of cardiac pathology. Some mitochondrial and metabolic dysfunctions have also been reported. Here we investigate cellular mechanisms responsible for impaired mitochondrial metabolism in dystrophic cardiomyopathy at early stages of the disease. We employed electrophysiological and imaging techniques to study mitochondrial structure and function in cardiomyocytes from mdx mice, an animal model of DMD. Here we show that mitochondrial matrix was progressively oxidized in myocytes isolated from mdx mice. Moreover, an abrupt increase in workload resulted in significantly more pronounced oxidation of mitochondria in dystrophic cells. Electron micrographs revealed a gradually increased number of damaged mitochondria in mdx myocytes. Degradation in mitochondrial structure was correlated with progressive increase in mitochondrial Ca2+ sequestration and mitochondrial depolarization, despite a substantial and persistent elevation in resting cytosolic sodium levels. Treatment of mdx cells with cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP), shifted both resting and workload-dependent mitochondrial redox state to the levels recorded in control myocytes. It also significantly reduced workload dependent depolarization of mitochondrial membrane in dystrophic cardiomyocytes. Overall, our studies highlight age dependent deterioration of mitochondrial function in dystrophic cardiomyocytes, which seems to be associated with excessive opening of mPTP due to oxidative stress and cellular Ca2+ overload.},

	abstract = {Key points Increased protein phosphatase 1 (PP-1) activity has been found in end stage human heart failure. Although PP-1 has been extensively studied, a detailed understanding of its role in the excitation–contraction coupling mechanism, in normal and diseased hearts, remains elusive. The present study investigates the functional effect of the PP-1 activity on local Ca2+ release events in ventricular cardiomyocytes, by using an activating peptide (PDP3) for the stimulation of the endogenous PP-1 protein. We report that acute de-phosphorylation may increase the sensitivity of RyR2 channels to Ca2+ in situ, and that the RyR2-serine2808 phosphorylation site may mediate such a process. Our approach unmasks the functional importance of PP-1 in the regulation of RyR2 activity, suggesting a potential role in the generation of a pathophysiological sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak in the diseased heart. Abstract Changes in cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) phosphorylation are considered to be important regulatory and disease related post-translational protein modifications. The extent of RyR2 phosphorylation is mainly determined by the balance of the activities of protein kinases and phosphatases, respectively. Increased protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) activity has been observed in heart failure, although the regulatory role of this enzyme on intracellular Ca2+ handling remains poorly understood. To determine the physiological and pathophysiological significance of increased PP-1 activity, we investigated how the PP-1 catalytic subunit (PP-1c) alters Ca2+ sparks in permeabilized cardiomyocytes and we also applied a PP-1-disrupting peptide (PDP3) to specifically activate endogenous PP-1, including the one anchored on the RyR2 macromolecular complex. We compared wild-type and transgenic mice in which the usually highly phosphorylated site RyR2-S2808 has been ablated to investigate its involvement in RyR2 modulation (S2808A+/+). In wild-type myocytes, PP-1 increased Ca2+ spark frequency by two-fold, followed by depletion of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ store. Similarly, PDP3 transiently increased spark frequency and decreased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ load. RyR2 Ca2+ sensitivity, which was assessed by Ca2+ spark recovery analysis, was increased in the presence of PDP3 compared to a negative control peptide. S2808A+/+ cardiomyocytes did not respond to both PP-1c and PDP3 treatment. Our results suggest an increased Ca2+ sensitivity of RyR2 upon de-phosphorylation by PP-1. Furthermore, we have confirmed the S2808 site as a target for PP-1 and as a potential link between RyR2s modulation and the cellular response.},

	abstract = {Key points In cardiac myocytes, subcellular local calcium release signals, calcium sparks, are recruited to form each cellular calcium transient and activate the contractile machinery. Abnormal timing of recovery of sparks after their termination may contribute to arrhythmias. We developed a method to interrogate recovery of calcium spark trigger probabilities and their amplitude over time using two-photon photolysis of a new ultra-effective caged calcium compound. The findings confirm the utility of the technique to define an elevated sensitivity of the calcium release mechanism in situ and to follow hastened recovery of spark trigger probabilities in a mouse model of an inherited cardiac arrhythmia, which was used for validation. Analogous methods are likely to be applicable to investigate other microscopic subcellular signalling systems in a variety of cell types. Abstract In cardiac myocytes Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through ryanodine receptors (RyRs) governs activation of contraction. Ca2+ release occurs via subcellular Ca2+ signalling events, Ca2+ sparks. Local recovery of Ca2+ release depends on both SR refilling and restoration of Ca2+ sensitivity of the RyRs. We used two-photon (2P) photolysis of the ultra-effective caged Ca2+ compound BIST-2EGTA and laser-scanning confocal Ca2+ imaging to probe refractoriness of local Ca2+ release in control conditions and in the presence of cAMP or low-dose caffeine (to stimulate CICR) or cyclopiazonic acid (CPA; to slow SR refilling). Permeabilized cardiomyocytes were loaded with BIST-2EGTA and rhod-2. Pairs of short 2P photolytic pulses (1 ms, 810 nm) were applied with different intervals to test Ca2+ release amplitude recovery and trigger probability for the second spark in a pair. Photolytic and biological events were distinguished by classification with a self-learning support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. In permeabilized myocytes data recorded in the presence of CPA showed a lower probability of triggering a second spark compared to control or cAMP conditions. Cardiomyocytes from a mouse model harbouring the arrhythmogenic RyRR420Q mutation were used for further validation and revealed a higher Ca2+ sensitivity of CICR. This new 2P approach provides composite information of Ca2+ release amplitude and trigger probability recovery reflecting both SR refilling and restoration of CICR and RyR Ca2+ sensitivity. It can be used to measure the kinetics of local CICR recovery, alterations of which may be related to premature heart beats and arrhythmias.},

	abstract = {Mutations of the RyR2 are channelopathies that can predispose to life threatening catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardias (CPVTs) during exercise or stress. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are causal for the arrhythmias downstream of the β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) activation are not defined. They may be specific and different for each particular RyR2 mutation. Obvious possibilities are the phosphorylation of the mutated RyR2s or the stimulation of the SR Ca2+ pump (SERCA), which could increase SR Ca2+ loading. Potentially arrhythmogenic Ca2+ signals, such as Ca2+ waves, were recorded and analyzed from WT and RyR2R420Q+/− mouse cardiomyocytes with confocal microscopy after field stimulation at 1 Hz. In RyR2R420Q+/− cardiomyocytes we found a higher occurrence and frequency of Ca2+ waves, particularly upon β-AR stimulation with isoproterenol. This was accompanied by a shorter latency to the first spontaneous wave. Wave velocity from raw traces, as well as amplitude and decay time constant (τ) analyzed in de-skewed traces were comparable in both cell types. To obtain further insight into the role of the SERCA we selectively stimulated SERCA in permeabilized myocytes using Fab fragments of a PLB antibody (2D12). Surprisingly, SERCA stimulation alone resulted in considerably higher wave frequencies than when mimicking β-AR stimulation with cAMP, particularly in RyR2R420Q+/− cardiomyocytes. This may be a consequence of some protective SR Ca2+ unloading resulting from the SR Ca2+ leak via phosphorylated RyR2s in cAMP. Spark-to-spark recovery analysis suggested a remarkably higher Ca2+ release sensitivity in RyR2R420Q+/− cells, both in control and upon β-AR stimulation. Together these findings suggest that the fine balance between SR Ca2+ loading via SERCA and the Ca2+ leak via mutated and phosphorylated RyR2s is an important determinant for the overall cellular arrhythmogenicity prevailing in the RyR2R420Q+/− myocytes.},

	abstract = {Objective: Cellular Ca2+ waves are understood as reaction–diffusion systems sustained by Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) from Ca2+ stores. Given the recently discovered sensitization of Ca2+ release channels (ryanodine receptors; RyRs) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by luminal SR Ca2+, waves could also be driven by RyR sensitization, mediated by SR overloading via Ca2+ pump (SERCA), acting in tandem with CICR.Methods: Confocal imaging of the Ca2+ indicator fluo-3 was combined with UV-flash photolysis of caged compounds and the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique to carry out these experiments in isolated guinea pig ventricular cardiomyocytes.Results: Upon sudden slowing of the SERCA in cardiomyocytes with a photoreleased inhibitor, waves indeed decelerated immediately. No secondary changes of Ca2+ signaling or SR Ca2+ content due to SERCA inhibition were observed in the short time-frame of these experiments.Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with Ca2+ loading resulting in a zone of RyR ‘sensitization’ traveling within the SR, but inconsistent with CICR as the predominant mechanism driving the Ca2+ waves. This alternative mode of RyR activation is essential to fully conceptualize cardiac arrhythmias triggered by spontaneous Ca2+ release.},

	abstract = {Local elevations in intracellular calcium ("Ca2+ sparks") in heart muscle are elementary sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+)-release events. Ca2+ sparks occur at a low rate in quiescent cells but can also be evoked by electrical stimulation of the cell to produce the cell-wide Ca2+ transient. In this study we investigate how Ca2+ sparks are related to propagating waves of elevated cytosolic Ca2+ induced by "Ca2+ overload." Single ventricular myocytes from rat were loaded with the Ca(2+)-sensitive indicator fluo 3 and imaged with a confocal microscope. After extracellular Ca2+ concentration was increased from 1 to 10 mM to produce Ca2+ overload, the frequency of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks, which occur at the t tubule/SR junction, increased approximately 4-fold, whereas the spark amplitude and spatial size increased 4.1-and 1.7-fold, respectively. In addition, a spectrum of larger subcellular events, including propagating Ca2+ waves, was observed. Ca2+ sparks were seen to occur at the majority (65\%) of the sites of wave initiation. For slowly propagating Ca2+ waves, discrete Ca(2+)-release events, similar to Ca2+ sparks, were detected in the wave front. These Ca2+ sparks appeared to recruit other sparks along the wave front so that the wave progressed in a saltatory manner. We conclude that Ca2+ sparks are elementary events that can explain both the initiation and propagation of Ca2+ waves. In addition, we show that Ca2+ waves and electrically evoked Ca2+ transients have the same time course and interact with each other in a manner that is consistent with both phenomena having the same underlying mechanism(s). These results suggest that SR Ca2+ release during Ca2+ waves, like that during normal excitation-contraction coupling, results from the spatial and temporal summation of Ca2+ sparks.},

IP3R type-2 (IP3R2) is the predominant IP3R isoform expressed in atrial myocytes. To determine the role of IP3R2 in atrial arrhythmogenesis and ECC, we generated IP3R2-deficient mice. Our results revealed that endothelin-1 (ET-1) stimulation of wild-type (WT) atrial myocytes caused an increase in basal [Ca2+]i, an enhancement of action potential (AP)-induced [Ca2+]i transients, an improvement of the efficacy of ECC (increased fractional SR Ca2+ release), and the occurrence of spontaneous arrhythmogenic Ca2+ release events as the result of activation of IP3R-dependent Ca2+ release. In contrast, ET-1 did not alter diastolic [Ca2+]i or cause spontaneous Ca2+ release events in IP3R2-deficient atrial myocytes. Under basal conditions the spatio-temporal properties (amplitude, rise-time, decay kinetics, and spatial spread) of [Ca2+]i transients and fractional SR Ca2+ release were not different in WT and IP3R2-deficient atrial myocytes. WT and IP3R2-deficient atrial myocytes also showed a significant and very similar increase in the amplitude of AP-dependent [Ca2+]i transients and Ca2+ spark frequency in response to isoproterenol stimulation, suggesting that both cell types maintained a strong inotropic reserve. No compensatory changes in Ca2+ regulatory protein expression (IP3R1, IP3R3, RyR2, NCX, SERCA2) or morphology of the atria could be detected between WT and IP3R2-deficient mice. These results show that lack of IP3R2 abolishes the positive inotropic effect of neurohumoral stimulation with ET-1 and protects from its arrhythmogenic effects.},

Panoptic segmentation unifies the typically distinct tasks of semantic segmentation (assign a class label to each pixel) and instance segmentation (detect and segment each object instance). The proposed task requires generating a coherent scene segmentation that is rich and complete, an important step toward real-world vision systems. While early work in computer vision addressed related image/scene parsing tasks, these are not currently popular, possibly due to lack of appropriate metrics or associated recognition challenges. To address this, we propose a novel panoptic quality (PQ) metric that captures performance for all classes (stuff and things) in an interpretable and unified manner. Using the proposed metric, we perform a rigorous study of both human and machine performance for PS on three existing datasets, revealing interesting insights about the task. The aim of our work is to revive the interest of the community in a more unified view of image segmentation.},

	abstract = {Background—
Little is known about the function of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) in the adult heart experimentally. Moreover, whether these Ca2+ release channels are present and play a critical role in human cardiomyocytes remains to be defined. IP3Rs may be activated after Gαq-protein–coupled receptor stimulation, affecting Ca2+ cycling, enhancing myocyte performance, and potentially favoring an increase in the incidence of arrhythmias.

Methods and Results—
IP3R function was determined in human left ventricular myocytes, and this analysis was integrated with assays in mouse myocytes to identify the mechanisms by which IP3Rs influence the electric and mechanical properties of the myocardium. We report that IP3Rs are expressed and operative in human left ventricular myocytes. After Gαq-protein–coupled receptor activation, Ca2+ mobilized from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via IP3Rs contributes to the decrease in resting membrane potential, prolongation of the action potential, and occurrence of early afterdepolarizations. Ca2+ transient amplitude and cell shortening are enhanced, and extrasystolic and dysregulated Ca2+ elevations and contractions become apparent. These alterations in the electromechanical behavior of human cardiomyocytes are coupled with increased isometric twitch of the myocardium and arrhythmic events, suggesting that Gαq-protein–coupled receptor activation provides inotropic reserve, which is hampered by electric instability and contractile abnormalities. Additionally, our findings support the notion that increases in Ca2+ load by IP3Rs promote Ca2+ extrusion by forward-mode Na+/Ca2+ exchange, an important mechanism of arrhythmic events.

Conclusions—
The Gαq-protein/coupled receptor/IP3R axis modulates the electromechanical properties of the human myocardium and its propensity to develop arrhythmias.},

Many cell stimuli act on receptors that are coupled to phospholipase C that hydrolyses phosphatidylinosol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to release IP3 to the cytosol. IP3 receptors located on the endoplasmic reticulum respond to this elevation of IP3 by releasing Ca2+, which is often organized into characteristic spatial (elementary events and waves) and temporal (Ca2+ oscillations) patterns. This IP3/Ca2+ pathway is a remarkably versatile signalling system that has been adapted to control processes as diverse as fertilization, proliferation, contraction, cell metabolism, vesicle and fluid secretion and information processing in neuronal cells.},

	abstract = {Ca sparks are elementary Ca-release events from intracellular Ca stores that are observed in virtually all types of muscle. Typically, Ca sparks are measured in the line-scan mode with confocal laser-scanning microscopes, yielding two-dimensional images (distance vs. time). The manual analysis of these images is time consuming and prone to errors as well as investigator bias. Therefore, we developed SparkMaster, an automated analysis program that allows rapid and reliable spark analysis. The underlying analysis algorithm is adapted from the threshold-based standard method of spark analysis developed by Cheng et al. (Biophys J 76: 606-617, 1999) and is implemented here in the freely available image-processing software ImageJ. SparkMaster offers a graphical user interface through which all analysis parameters and output options are selected. The analysis includes general image parameters (number of detected sparks, spark frequency) and individual spark parameters (amplitude, full width at half-maximum amplitude, full duration at half-maximum amplitude, full width, full duration, time to peak, maximum steepness of spark upstroke, time constant of spark decay). We validated the algorithm using images with synthetic sparks embedded into backgrounds with different signal-to-noise ratios to determine an analysis criteria at which a high sensitivity is combined with a low frequency of false-positive detections. Finally, we applied SparkMaster to analyze experimental data of sparks measured in intact and permeabilized ventricular cardiomyocytes, permeabilized mammalian skeletal muscle, and intact smooth muscle cells. We found that SparkMaster provides a reliable, easy to use, and fast way of analyzing Ca sparks in a wide variety of experimental conditions.},

	abstract = {The action of 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) on Ca2+ signalling in HeLa cells and cardiac myocytes was investigated. Consistent with other studies, we found that superfusion of cells with 2-APB rapidly inhibited inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3)-mediated Ca2+ release and store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOC). In addition to abrogating hormone-evoked Ca2+ responses, 2-APB could antagonise Ca2+ signals evoked by a membrane permeant InsP3 ester. 2-APB also slowed the recovery of intracellular Ca2+ signals consistent with an effect on Ca2+ ATPases. The inhibitory action of 2-APB on InsP3 receptors (InsP3Rs), SOC channels and Ca2+ pumps persisted for several minutes after washout of the compound. Application of 2-APB to unstimulated cells had no effect on subsequent Ca2+ responses suggesting that it has a use-dependent action. Mitochondria in cells treated with 2-APB showed a rapid and slowly reversible swelling. 2-APB did not cause the mitochondria to depolarise, but it reduced the extent of mitochondrial calcium uptake. Although 2-APB has been demonstrated not to affect voltage-operated Ca2+ channels or ryanodine receptors, we found that it gave a concentration-dependent long-lasting inhibition of Ca2+ signalling in electrically-stimulated cardiac myocytes, where InsP3Rs and SOC channels do not play a signiﬁcant role. Our data suggest that 2-APB has multiple cellular targets, a use-dependent action, is difﬁcult to reverse and may affect Ca2+ signalling in cell types where InsP3 and SOC are not active.},

Observations were made at 17–20°C on fibers from Rana pipiens and Rana temporaria. Fibers were studied in two external solutions: normal Ringer's ([K+] = 2.5 mM; estimated membrane potential, −80 to −90 mV) and elevated [K+] Ringer's (most frequently, [K+] = 13 mM; estimated membrane potential, −60 to −65 mV). The frequency of sparks was 0.04–0.05 sarcomere−1 s−1 in normal Ringer's; the frequency increased approximately tenfold in 13 mM [K+] Ringer's. Spark properties in each solution were similar for the two species; they were also similar when scanned in the x and the y directions. From fits of standard functional forms to the temporal and spatial profiles of the sparks, the following mean values were estimated for the morphological parameters: rise time, ∼4 ms; peak amplitude, ∼1 ΔF/F (change in fluorescence divided by resting fluorescence); decay time constant, ∼5 ms; full duration at half maximum (FDHM), ∼6 ms; late offset, ∼0.01 ΔF/F; full width at half maximum (FWHM), ∼1.0 μm; mass (calculated as amplitude × 1.206 × FWHM3), 1.3–1.9 μm3. Although the rise time is similar to that measured previously in frog cut fibers (5–6 ms; 17–23°C), cut fiber sparks have a longer duration (FDHM, 9–15 ms), a wider extent (FWHM, 1.3–2.3 μm), and a strikingly larger mass (by 3–10-fold). Possible explanations for the increase in mass in cut fibers are a reduction in the Ca2+ buffering power of myoplasm in cut fibers and an increase in the flux of Ca2+ during release.},

	abstract = {In heart cells, Ca2+ released from the internal storage unit, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through ryanodine receptor (RyR2) channels is the predominant determinant of cardiac contractility. Evidence obtained in recent years suggests that SR Ca2+ release is tightly regulated not only by cytosolic Ca2+ but also by intra-store Ca2+ concentration. Speciﬁcally, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) that relies on auto-catalytic action of Ca2+ at the cytosolic side of RyR2s is precisely balanced and counteracted by RyR2 deactivation dependent on a reciprocal decrease of Ca2+ at the luminal side of RyR2s. Dysregulation of this inherently unstable Ca2+ signaling is considered to be an underlying cause of triggered arrhythmias, and is associated with genetic and acquired forms of sudden cardiac death. In this article, we present an overview of recent advances in our understanding of the regulatory role luminal Ca2+ plays in Ca2+ handling, with a particular emphasis on the role of Ca2+release refractoriness in aberrant Ca2+ release.

	abstract = {Rationale A higher expression/activity of type 1 serine/threonine protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) may contribute to dephosphorylation of cardiac regulatory proteins triggering the development of heart failure. Objective Here, we tested the putatively protective effects of PP1 inhibitor-2 (I2) overexpression using a heart failure model induced by chronic β-adrenergic stimulation. Methods and results Transgenic (TG) and wild-type (WT) mice were subjected to isoprenaline (ISO) or isotonic NaCl solution supplied via osmotic minipumps for 7 days. I2 overexpression was associated with a depressed PP1 activity. Basal contractility was unchanged in catheterized mice and isolated cardiomyocytes between TGNaCl and WTNaCl. TGISO mice exhibited more fibrosis and a higher expression of hypertrophy marker proteins as compared to WTISO. After acute administration of ISO, the contractile response was accompanied by a higher sensitivity in TGISO as compared to WTISO. In contrast to basal contractility, the peak amplitude of [Ca]i and SR Ca load were reduced in TGNaCl as compared to WTNaCl. These effects were normalized to WT levels after chronic ISO stimulation. Cardiomyocyte relaxation and [Ca]i decay kinetics were hastened in TGISO as compared to WTISO, which can be explained by a higher phospholamban phosphorylation at Ser16. Chronic catecholamine stimulation was followed by an enhanced expression of GSK3β, whereas the phosphorylation at Ser9 was lower in TG as compared to the corresponding WT group. This resulted in a higher I2 phosphorylation that may reactivate PP1. Conclusion Our findings suggest that the basal desensitization of β-adrenergic signaling and the depressed Ca handling in TG by inhibition of PP1 is restored by a GSK3β-dependent phosphorylation of I2.},

	abstract = {During physical exercise or stress, the sympathetic system stimulates cardiac contractility via β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) activation, resulting in protein kinase A (PKA)–mediated phosphorylation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor RyR2. PKA-dependent “hyperphosphorylation” of the RyR2 channel has been proposed as a major impairment that contributes to progression of heart failure. However, the sites of PKA phosphorylation and their phosphorylation status in cardiac diseases are not well defined. Among the known RyR2 phosphorylation sites, serine 2030 (S2030) remains highly controversial as a site of functional impact. We examined the contribution of RyR2-S2030 to Ca2+ signaling and excitation–contraction coupling (ECC) in a transgenic mouse with an ablated RyR2-S2030 phosphorylation site (RyR2-S2030A+/+). We assessed ECC gain by using whole-cell patch–clamp recordings and confocal Ca2+ imaging during β-ARs stimulation with isoproterenol (Iso) and consistent SR Ca2+ loading and L-type Ca2+ current (ICa) triggering. Under these conditions, ECC gain is diminished in mutant compared with WT cardiomyocytes. Resting Ca2+ spark frequency (CaSpF) with Iso is also reduced by mutation of S2030. In permeabilized cells, when SR Ca2+ pump activity is kept constant (using 2D12 antibody against phospholamban), cAMP does not change CaSpF in S2030A+/+ myocytes. Using Ca2+ spark recovery analysis, we found that mutant RyR Ca2+ sensitivity is not enhanced by Iso application, contrary to WT RyRs. Furthermore, ablation of RyR2-S2030 prevents acceleration of Ca2+ waves and increases latency to the first spontaneous Ca2+ release after a train of stimulations during Iso treatment. Together, these results suggest that phosphorylation at S2030 may represent an important step in the modulation of RyR2 activity during β-adrenergic stimulation and a potential target for the development of new antiarrhythmic drugs.},

In the present study, we examined the properties and physiological relevance of phosphorylation of these two sites. Using site- and phospho-specific antibodies, we demonstrated that Ser-2030 of both recombinant and native RyR2 from a number of species was phosphorylated by PKA, indicating that Ser-2030 is a highly conserved PKA site. Furthermore, we found that the phosphorylation of Ser-2030 responded to isoproterenol (isoprenaline) stimulation in rat cardiac myocytes in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, whereas Ser-2808 was already substantially phosphorylated before β-adrenergic stimulation, and the extent of the increase in Ser-2808 phosphorylation after β-adrenergic stimulation was much less than that for Ser-2030. Interestingly, the isoproterenol-induced phosphorylation of Ser-2030, but not of Ser-2808, was markedly inhibited by PKI, a specific inhibitor of PKA. The basal phosphorylation of Ser-2808 was also insensitive to PKA inhibition. Moreover, Ser-2808, but not Ser-2030, was stoichiometrically phosphorylated by PKG (protein kinase G). In addition, we found no significant phosphorylation of RyR2 at the Ser-2030 PKA site in failing rat hearts. Importantly, isoproterenol stimulation markedly increased the phosphorylation of Ser-2030, but not of Ser-2808, in failing rat hearts. Taken together, these observations indicate that Ser-2030, but not Ser-2808, is the major PKA phosphorylation site in RyR2 responding to PKA activation upon β-adrenergic stimulation in both normal and failing hearts, and that RyR2 is not hyperphosphorylated by PKA in heart failure. Our results also suggest that phosphorylation of RyR2 at Ser-2030 may be an important event associated with altered Ca2+ handling and cardiac arrhythmia that is commonly observed in heart failure upon β-adrenergic stimulation.},

However, the sites of PKA phosphorylation in RyR2 and their phosphorylation status in HF are not well defined. Here we used various approaches to investigate the phosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA. Mutating serine-2808, which was thought to be the only PKA phosphorylation site in RyR2, did not abolish the phosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping revealed two major PKA phosphopeptides, one of which corresponded to the known serine-2808 site. Another, novel, PKA phosphorylation site, serine 2030, was identified by Edman sequencing. Using phospho-specific antibodies, we showed that the novel serine-2030 site was phosphorylated in rat cardiac myocytes stimulated with isoproterenol, but not in unstimulated cells, whereas serine-2808 was considerably phosphorylated before and after isoproterenol treatment. We further showed that serine-2030 was stoichiometrically phosphorylated by PKA, but not by CaMKII, and that mutations of serine-2030 altered neither the FKBP12.6-RyR2 interaction nor the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding. Moreover, the levels of phosphorylation of RyR2 at serine-2030 and serine-2808 in both failing and non-failing canine hearts were similar. Together, our data indicate that serine-2030 is a major PKA phosphorylation site in RyR2 responding to acute β-adrenergic stimulation, and that RyR2 is not hyperphosphorylated by PKA in canine HF.},

Using crystal structures, we show that the phosphorylation hotspot domain of RyR2 embraces the PKA catalytic subunit, with an extensive interface not seen in PKA complexes with peptides. We trapped an intermediary open-form PKA bound to the RyR2 domain and an ATP analog, showing that PKA can engage substrates in an open form. Phosphomimetics or prior phosphorylation at nearby sites in RyR2 either enhance or reduce the activity of PKA. Finally, we show that a phosphomimetic at S2813, a well-known target site for calmodulin-dependent kinase II, induces the formation of an alpha helix in the phosphorylation domain, resulting in increased interactions and PKA activity. This shows that the different phosphorylation sites in RyR2 are not independent.},

Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations.

While CICR provides for robust triggering of Ca2+ sparks, the mechanisms underlying their termination remain unknown. At present, it is unclear how a cluster of Ca2+ release channels (ryanodine receptors or RyRs) can be made to turn off when their activity is sustained by the Ca2+ release itself. We use a novel experimental approach to investigate indirectly this issue by exploring restitution of Ca2+ sparks. We exploit the fact that ryanodine can bind, nearly irreversibly, to an RyR subunit (monomer) and increase the open probability of the homotetrameric channel. By applying low concentrations of ryanodine to rat ventricular myocytes, we observe repeated activations of individual Ca2+ spark sites. Examination of these repetitive Ca2+ sparks reveals that spark amplitude recovers with a time constant of 91 ms whereas the sigmoidal recovery of triggering probability lags behind amplitude recovery by ∼80 ms. We conclude that restitution of Ca2+ sparks depends on local refilling of SR stores after depletion and may also depend on another time-dependent process such as recovery from inactivation or a slow conformational change after rebinding of Ca2+ to SR regulatory proteins.},

About 99\% of the cytoplasmic calcium in cardiac myocytes is bound to buffers, and their properties will therefore have a major influence on Ca2+ signaling. This article considers the fundamental properties and identities of the buffers and how to measure them. It reviews the effects of buffering on the systolic Ca2+ transient and how this may change physiologically, and in heart failure and both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, as well. It is concluded that the consequences of this strong buffering may be more significant than currently appreciated, and a fuller understanding is needed for proper understanding of cardiac calcium cycling and contractility.},

Three major serine-threonine phosphatases including PP1, PP2A and PP2B (calcineurin) have been implicated in modulation of RyR2 function. Changes in expression levels of these phosphatases, their activity and targeting to the RyR2 macromolecular complex were demonstrated in many animal models of cardiac disease and humans and are implicated in cardiac arrhythmia and heart failure. Here we review evidence in support of regulation of RyR2-mediated SR Ca2+ release by serine-threonine phosphatases and the role and mechanisms of dysregulation of phosphatases in various disease states.},

We have previously shown that RyR2 is phosphorylated by PKA at two major sites, serine 2030 and serine 2808, of which Ser-2030 is the major PKA site responding to β-adrenergic stimulation. Here we investigated the effect of the phosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA on the properties of single channels and on spontaneous Ca2+ release during sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ overload, a process we have referred to as store overload-induced Ca2+ release (SOICR). We found that PKA activated single RyR2 channels in the presence, but not in the absence, of luminal Ca2+. On the other hand, PKA had no marked effect on the sensitivity of the RyR2 channel to activation by cytosolic Ca2+. Importantly, the S2030A mutation, but not mutations of Ser-2808, diminished the effect of PKA on RyR2. Furthermore, a phosphomimetic mutation, S2030D, potentiated the response of RyR2 to luminal Ca2+ and enhanced the propensity for SOICR in HEK293 cells. In intact rat ventricular myocytes, the activation of PKA by isoproterenol reduced the amplitude and increased the frequency of SOICR. Confocal line-scanning fluorescence microscopy further revealed that the activation of PKA by isoproterenol increased the rate of Ca2+ release and the propagation velocity of spontaneous Ca2+ waves, despite reduced wave amplitude and resting cytosolic Ca2+. Collectively, our data indicate that PKA-dependent phosphorylation enhances the response of RyR2 to luminal Ca2+ and reduces the threshold for SOICR and that this effect of PKA is largely mediated by phosphorylation at Ser-2030.},

	abstract = {During physical exercise and stress, the sympathetic system stimulates cardiac contractility via β-adrenergic receptor activation, resulting in protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor, RyR2, at Ser2808. Hyperphosphorylation of RyR2-S2808 has been proposed as a mechanism contributing to arrhythmogenesis and heart failure. However, the role of RyR2 phosphorylation during β-adrenergic stimulation remains controversial. We examined the contribution of RyR2-S2808 phosphorylation to altered excitation–contraction coupling and Ca2+ signaling using an experimental approach at the interface of molecular and cellular levels and a transgenic mouse with ablation of the RyR2-S2808 phosphorylation site (RyR2-S2808A). Experimentally challenging the communication between L-type Ca2+ channels and RyR2 led to a spatiotemporal de-synchronization of RyR2 openings, as visualized using confocal Ca2+ imaging. β-Adrenergic stimulation re-synchronized RyR2s, but less efficiently in RyR2-S2808A than in control cardiomyocytes, as indicated by comprehensive analysis of RyR2 activation. In addition, spontaneous Ca2+ waves in RyR2-S2808A myocytes showed significantly slowed propagation and complete absence of acceleration during β-adrenergic stress, unlike wild type cells. Single channel recordings revealed an attenuation of luminal Ca2+ sensitivity in RyR2-S2808A channels upon addition of PKA. This suggests that phosphorylation of RyR2-S2808 may be involved in RyR2 modulation by luminal (intra-SR) Ca2+ ([Ca2+]SR). We show here by three independent experimental approaches that PKA-dependent RyR2-S2808 phosphorylation plays significant functional roles at the subcellular level, namely, Ca2+ release synchronization, Ca2+ wave propagation and functional adaptation of RyR2 to variable [Ca2+]SR. These results indicate a direct mechanistic link between RyR2 phosphorylation and SR luminal Ca2+ sensing.},

This review will consider the relative contribution of RyR2-mediated Ca2+ leak to the profound cellular, transcriptional and electrical remodelling associated with HF. In particular, it will focus on our current understanding of the role of defective phosphorylation of RyR2 as a both a chronic mediator of excitation–contraction coupling (ECC) dysfunction and as a potent catalyst of RyR2-dependent arrhythmogenesis. A hypothetical concept that SR Ca2+ leak fundamentally underlies the increased arrhythmogenic susceptibility in HF, but that it may not directly contribute to contractile dysfunction, which may involve maladaptive perturbations in metabolism and energy utilization, is also discussed.},

We measured phosphorylation with at least two different antibodies per site and demonstrate that for S2808 results were highly antibody-dependent and two out of three S2808 antibodies did not accurately report phosphorylation level. The RyR was substantially phosphorylated in quiescent rat cardiomyocytes at S2808 and less so at S2814, but appeared to be unphosphorylated at S2030. Basal phosphorylation at S2808/S2814 was maintained by a Ca2+ dependent kinase other than Ca2+/Calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMKII). During stimulation with Isoproterenol S2808 was phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) and S2814 was phosphorylated by CaMKII.

Addition of AcPh (1-20 U ml-1) to a standard incubation medium increased [3H]ryanodine binding in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner. Stimulation was only readily apparent in media containing micromolar Ca2+ concentrations. 3. Scatchard analysis of [3H]ryanodine binding curves revealed that AcPh enhanced binding by increasing the affinity of the receptor for [3H]ryanodine without recruiting additional receptor sites (Kd, 9.8 +/- 0.85 and 3.9 +/- 0.65 nM; Bmax (the maximal receptor density), 1.45 +/- 0.14 and 1.47 +/- 0.12 pmol mg-1 for control and AcPh, respectively). The failure of AcPh to increase Bmax suggested that the number of receptors that were ‘dormant’ due to phosphorylation in the SR preparation was very small. 4. At the single channel level, AcPh increased the open probability (Po) of RyR channels by increasing the opening rate and inducing the appearance of a longer open state while having no effect on single channel conductance. Thus AcPh acted directly on RyR channels or a closely associated regulatory protein. 5. CaMKII decreased both [3H]ryanodine binding and Po of RyRs when added to medium supplemented with micromolar levels of Ca2+ and calmodulin (CaM). Addition of a synthetic peptide inhibitor of CaMKII, or replacement of ATP with the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue adenylyl[beta, gamma-methylene]-diphosphate (AMP-PCP), prevented CaMKII inhibition of RyRs, suggesting that CaMKII acted specifically through a phosphorylation mechanism. 6. The inhibition of RyR channel activity by CaMKII was reversed by the addition of AcPh. Thus we showed that an in vitro phosphorylation-dephosphorylation mechanism effectively regulates RyRs. 7. The results suggest that intracellular signalling pathways that lead to activation of CaMKII may reduce efflux of Ca2+ from the SR by inhibition of RyR channel activity. The Ca2+ dependence of CaMKII inhibition suggests that the role of the phosphorylation mechanism is to modulate the RyR response to Ca2+.},

However, interpretations of these results may depend on multiple Ca transport systems and interaction with intracellular Ca binding sites. We measured [Ca]i in voltage-clamped ventricular myocytes isolated from rat hearts using indo 1 fluorescence. Conditions were chosen where [Ca]i decline was expected to depend almost exclusively on the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca pump. The half time of [Ca]i decline (t1/2) decreased as the amplitude of the intracellular Ca (Cai) transient increased. This is not the result that would be expected from a transport system where the transport rate is a linear function of free [Ca]i. In this case the time constant of [Ca]i decline (tau) should be independent of the peak value of [Ca]i. This is also true if linear buffering of Cai is included. We develop a simple but more realistic theoretical framework where Ca transport rate and Ca binding both depend on free [Ca]i with Michaelis-Menten type functions. We demonstrate that the observed decline in apparent tau with increasing peak [Ca]i is entirely expected on theoretical grounds and over a wide range of characteristics for Ca transport and binding. We conclude that one cannot draw inferences about the intrinsic Ca transport function based on tau values unless the Cai transient has a comparable size.},

	abstract = {Heart failure (HF) has become increasingly common within the elderly population, decreasing their survival and overall quality of life. In fact, despite the improvements in treatment, many elderly people suffer from cardiac dysfunction (HF, valvular diseases, arrhythmias or hypertension-induced cardiac hypertrophy) that are much more common in an older fragile heart. Since β-adrenergic receptor (β-AR) signaling is abnormal in failing as well as aged hearts, this pathway is an effective diagnostic and therapeutic target. Both HF and aging are characterized by activation/hyperactivity of various neurohormonal pathways, the most important of which is the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). SNS hyperactivity is initially a compensatory mechanism to stimulate contractility and maintain cardiac output. Unfortunately, this chronic stimulation becomes detrimental and causes decreased cardiac function as well as reduced inotropic reserve due to a decrease in cardiac β-ARs responsiveness. Therapies which (e.g., β-blockers and physical activity) restore β-ARs responsiveness can ameliorate cardiac performance and outcomes during HF, particularly in older patients. In this review, we will discuss physiological β-adrenergic signaling and its alterations in both HF and aging as well as the potential clinical application of targeting β-adrenergic signaling in these disease processes.},

The commonest statistical approach is to treat data collected from each cell as independent, even though they are really clustered with multiple likely similar cells from each heart. In this study, we test whether this statistical assumption of independence can lead the investigator to draw conclusions that would be considered erroneous if the analysis handled clustering with specific statistical techniques (hierarchical tests). Ca2+ transients were recorded in cells loaded with Fura-2AM and sparks were recorded in cells loaded with Fluo-4AM. Data were analysed twice, once with the common statistical approach (assumption of independence) and once with hierarchical statistical methodologies designed to allow for any clustering. The statistical tests found that there was significant hierarchical clustering. This caused the common statistical approach to underestimate the standard error and report artificially small P values. For example, this would have led to the erroneous conclusion that time to 50\% peak transient amplitude was significantly prolonged in HF. Spark analysis showed clustering, both within each cell and also within each rat, for morphological variables. This means that a three-level hierarchical model is sometimes required for such measures. Standard statistical methodologies, if used instead, erroneously suggest that spark amplitude is significantly greater in HF and spark duration is reduced in HF. Ca2+ fluxes in isolated cardiomyocytes show so much clustering that the common statistical approach that assumes independence of each data point will frequently give the false appearance of statistically significant changes. Hierarchical statistical methodologies need a little more effort, but are necessary for reliable conclusions. We present cost-free simple tools for performing these analyses.},

Cardiac myocytes from AnkB heterozygous mice (AnkB+/−) show reduced expression and altered localization of Na/Ca exchanger (NCX) and Na/K-ATPase (NKA), key players in regulating [Na]i and [Ca]i. Here we investigate how AnkB reduction affects cardiac [Na]i, [Ca]i and SR Ca release. We found reduced NCX and NKA transport function but unaltered [Na]i and diastolic [Ca]i in myocytes from AnkB+/− vs. wild-type (WT) mice. Ca transients, SR Ca content and fractional SR Ca release were larger in AnkB+/− myocytes. The frequency of spontaneous, diastolic Ca sparks (CaSpF) was significantly higher in intact myocytes from AnkB+/− vs. WT myocytes (with and without isoproterenol), even when normalized for SR Ca load. However, total ryanodine receptor (RyR)-mediated SR Ca leak (tetracaine-sensitive) was not different between groups. Thus, in AnkB+/− mice SR Ca leak is biased towards more Ca sparks (vs. smaller release events), suggesting more coordinated openings of RyRs in a cluster. This is due to local cytosolic RyR regulation, rather than intrinsic RyR differences, since CaSpF was similar in saponin-permeabilized myocytes from WT and AnkB+/− mice. The more coordinated RyRs openings resulted in an increased propensity of pro-arrhythmic Ca waves in AnkB+/− myocytes. In conclusion, AnkB reduction alters cardiac Na and Ca transport and enhances the coupled RyR openings, resulting in more frequent Ca sparks and waves although the total SR Ca leak is unaffected. This could enhance the propensity for triggered arrhythmias in AnkB+/− mice.},

	abstract = {Purpose The detection and segmentation of surgical instruments has been a vital step for many applications in minimally invasive surgical robotics. Previously, the problem was tackled from a semantic segmentation perspective, yet these methods fail to provide good segmentation maps of instrument types and do not contain any information on the instance afﬁliation of each pixel. We propose to overcome this limitation by using a novel instance segmentation method which ﬁrst masks instruments and then classiﬁes them into their respective type.
Methods We introduce a novel method for instance segmentation where a pixel-wise mask of each instance is found prior to classiﬁcation. An encoder–decoder network is used to extract instrument instances, which are then separately classiﬁed using the features of the previous stages. Furthermore, we present a method to incorporate instrument priors from surgical robots.
Results Experiments are performed on the robotic instrument segmentation dataset of the 2017 endoscopic vision challenge. We perform a fourfold cross-validation and show an improvement of over 18\% to the previous state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we perform an ablation study which highlights the importance of certain design choices and observe an increase of 10\% over semantic segmentation methods.
Conclusions We have presented a novel instance segmentation method for surgical instruments which outperforms previous semantic segmentation-based methods. Our method further provides a more informative output of instance level information, while retaining a precise segmentation mask. Finally, we have shown that robotic instrument priors can be used to further increase the performance.},

Two major phosphorylation sites, S2808 and S2814, are respective targets for PKA and CaMKII and form a RyR2 “phosphorylation hot spot”. We previously showed that genetic ablation of S2808 has no structural or functional consequences for cardiac function. Here we generated a novel double knock-in mouse with genetic ablation of S2808 and S2814 (S2808A/S2814A) and tested the hypothesis that preventing the “hot spot” phosphorylation has discernible impact in cardiac function. Echocardiography and intraventricular pressure measurements revealed that, under basal conditions, S2808A/S2814A mice have higher heart rate (553±33 vs. 460±28 bpm, p{\textless}0.05, n= 8/group) and decreased ejection fraction (55±3vs. 65±2\%, p{\textless}0.05, n=12/group) compared to WT. In addition, ventricular myocytes isolated from the S2808A/S2814A hearts displayed a significant increase in Ca2+ transient amplitude (357±27 vs. 257±31 nM, p{\textless}0.05, n=13 cells/group), a trend towards higher Ca2+ spark frequency (0.51±0.14 vs. 0.30±0.17 sparks.100 μm-1.sec-1, n=7 cells/group) while the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ load was comparable to that of WT cells (107±7 vs. 97±4 μmol/L cytosol). Surprisingly, β-adrenergic stimulation eliminated the differences between the two groups: Langerdorff-perfused hearts displayed a robust increase in the amplitude of contraction in response to 200 nM isoprenaline (51±4 vs. 62±14\% above control in double knock-in and WT mice, respectively; n=5/group) and in isolated ventricular myocytes, 100 nM isoproterenol significantly increased the Ca2+ transient amplitude (1.99±0.18 vs. 1.47±0.15 μM, n= 7 cells/group) and SR Ca2+ load (175±12 vs. 183±14 μmol/L cytosol) in double knock-in and WT mice, respectively. Thus, ablation of the “phosphorylation hot spot” has discernible effects on cardiac function at baseline, but under β-adrenergic stimulation other RyR2 phosphorylation sites appear to normalize Ca2+ transient and cardiac contraction. This is compatible with a multi-phosphorylation site model of RyR2 where the β-adrenergic stimulation response is dictated by a complex interplay of phosphorylations.},

In this scheme, persistent activation of the sympathetic system during chronic stress leads to PKA "hyperphosphorylation" of RyR2-S2808, which increases Ca2+ release by augmenting the sensitivity of the RyR2 channel to diastolic Ca2+. This gain-of-function is postulated to occur with the unique participation of RyR2-S2808, and other potential PKA phosphorylation sites have been discarded. Although it is clear that RyR2 is among the first proteins in the heart to be phosphorylated by beta-adrenergic stimulation, the functional impact of phosphorylation in excitation-contraction coupling and cardiac performance remains unclear. We used gene targeting to produce a mouse model with complete ablation of the RyR2-S2808 phosphorylation site (RyR2-S2808A). Whole-heart and isolated cardiomyocyte experiments were performed to test the role of beta-adrenergic stimulation and PKA phosphorylation of Ser2808 in heart failure progression and cellular Ca2+ handling. We found that the RyR2-S2808A mutation does not alter the beta-adrenergic response, leaves cellular function almost unchanged, and offers no significant protection in the maladaptive cardiac remodeling induced by chronic stress. Moreover, the RyR2-S2808A mutation appears to modify single-channel activity, although modestly and only at activating [Ca2+]. Taken together, these results reveal some of the most important effects of PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 but do not support a major role for RyR2-S2808 phosphorylation in the pathogenesis of cardiac dysfunction and failure.},

Prior treatment of the microsomes with the ionophores alamethicin or A23187 produced no change in the extent of stimulation of the ATPase activity by heparin yet eliminated net calcium uptake. This finding and a lack of change in the stoichiometric ratio of mol of calcium transported/mol of ATP hydrolyzed (calcium: ATP) suggest that the effect of heparin is on the calcium pump rather than on a parallel calcium efflux pathway. Certain polycationic compounds including poly-L-arginine and histone inhibited both cardiac and fast skeletal muscle microsomal calcium uptake and also produced no change in the stoichiometric ratio of calcium to ATP. Several lines of evidence indicate that the polyanionic compounds tested stimulate calcium uptake by interacting with phospholamban, the putative phosphorylatable regulator of the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium pump, whereas polycationic compounds appear to interact with the pump. (i) Heparin stimulated calcium uptake to the same extent as protein kinase A or trypsin, whereas prior phosphorylation or tryptic cleavage of phospholamban from the membrane abolished the stimulatory effect of heparin. (ii) Calcium uptake and (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity in fast skeletal muscle microsomes, which lack phospholamban, were unaffected by heparin. (iii) Purified cardiac (Ca2+ + Mg2+)-ATPase activity was no longer stimulated by heparin yet was still inhibited by polycationic compounds. The heparin-induced stimulation of calcium uptake was dependent on the pH and ionic strength of the heparin-containing preincubation medium, hence electrostatic interactions appear to play a significant role in heparin's stimulatory action. The data are consistent with an inhibitory role of the positively charged cytoplasmic domain of phospholamban with respect to calcium pump activity and the relief of the inhibition upon reduction in phospholamban's positive charge by phosphorylation or binding of polyanions.},

Therefore, we measured whole-cell Ca currents (ICa), Na-Ca exchange currents (INaCa), cellular contractions, and intracellular Ca transients in adult rabbit cardiac myocytes. We found that changing pipette Na concentration markedly affected the relationship between cell shortening (or Ca transients) and voltage, but did not affect the Ca current-voltage relationship. We then inhibited Na-Ca exchange and varied SR content (by changing the number of conditioning pulses before each test pulse). Regardless of SR Ca content, the relationship between contraction and voltage was bell-shaped in the absence of Na-Ca exchange. Next, we rapidly and completely blocked ICa by applying nifedipine to cells. Cellular shortening was variably reduced in the presence of nifedipine. The component of shortening blocked by nifedipine had a bell-shaped relationship with voltage, whereas the “nifedipine-insensitive” component of contraction increased with voltage. With the SR disabled (ryanodine and thapsigargin pretreatment), ICa could initiate late-peaking contractions that were ∼70\% of control amplitude. In contrast, nifedipine-insensitive contractions could not be elicited in the presence of ryanodine and thapsigargin. Finally, we recorded reverse Na-Ca exchange currents that were activated by membrane depolarization. The estimated sarcolemmal Ca flux occurring by Na-Ca exchange (during voltage clamp steps to +30mV) was ∼10-fold less than that occurring by ICa. Therefore, Na-Ca exchange alone is unlikely to raise cytosolic Ca concentration enough to directly activate the myofilaments. We conclude that reverse Na-Ca exchange can trigger SR Ca release. Because of the sigmoidal relationship between the open probability of the SR Ca release channel and pCa, the effects of ICa and INaCa may not sum in a linear fashion. Rather, the two triggers may act synergistically in the modulation of SR release.},

Added protein kinase C (PKC) also phosphorylated the cardiac ryanodine receptor but at a relatively slow rate.

Phosphorylation by CaM kinase occurs at a single site encompassing serine 2809. Antibodies generated to this site react only with the cardiac isoform of the ryanodine receptor, and immunoprecipitate only cardiac [3H]ryanodine-binding sites. When cardiac junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles or partially purified ryanodine receptors are fused with planar bilayers, phosphorylation at this site activates the Ca2+ channel. In tissues expressing the cardiac isoform of the ryanodine receptor, such as heart and brain, phosphorylation of the Ca2+ release channel by CaM kinase may provide a unique mechanism for regulating intracellular Ca2+ release.},

	abstract = {RATIONALE: Abnormal behavior of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) has been linked to cardiac arrhythmias and heart failure (HF) after myocardial infarction (MI). It has been proposed that protein kinase A (PKA) hyperphosphorylation of the RyR2 at a single residue, Ser-2808, is a critical mediator of RyR dysfunction, depressed cardiac performance, and HF after MI.
OBJECTIVE: We used a mouse model (RyRS2808A) in which PKA hyperphosphorylation of the RyR2 at Ser-2808 is prevented to determine whether loss of PKA phosphorylation at this site averts post MI cardiac pump dysfunction.
METHODS AND RESULTS: MI was induced in wild-type (WT) and S2808A mice. Myocyte and cardiac function were compared in WT and S2808A animals before and after MI. The effects of the PKA activator Isoproterenol (Iso) on L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)), contractions, and [Ca(2+)](I) transients were also measured. Both WT and S2808A mice had depressed pump function after MI, and there were no differences between groups. MI size was also identical in both groups. L type Ca(2+) current, contractions, Ca(2+) transients, and SR Ca(2+) load were also not significantly different in WT versus S2808A myocytes either before or after MI. Iso effects on Ca(2+) current, contraction, Ca(2+) transients, and SR Ca(2+) load were identical in WT and S2808A myocytes before and after MI at both low and high concentrations.
CONCLUSIONS: These results strongly support the idea that PKA phosphorylation of RyR-S2808 is irrelevant to the development of cardiac dysfunction after MI, at least in the mice used in this study.},

	abstract = {Background:
Enhanced diastolic calcium (Ca2+) release through ryanodine receptor type-2 (RyR2) has been implicated in atrial fibrillation (AF) promotion. Diastolic sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak is caused by increased RyR2 phosphorylation by PKA (protein kinase A) or CaMKII (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase-II) phosphorylation, or less dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases. However, considerable controversy remains regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying altered RyR2 function in AF. We thus aimed to determine the role of SPEG (striated muscle preferentially expressed protein kinase), a novel regulator of RyR2 phosphorylation, in AF pathogenesis.

Methods:
Western blotting was performed with right atrial biopsies from patients with paroxysmal AF. SPEG atrial knockout mice were generated using adeno-associated virus 9. In mice, AF inducibility was determined using intracardiac programmed electric stimulation, and diastolic Ca2+ leak in atrial cardiomyocytes was assessed using confocal Ca2+ imaging. Phosphoproteomics studies and Western blotting were used to measure RyR2 phosphorylation. To test the effects of RyR2-S2367 phosphorylation, knockin mice with an inactivated S2367 phosphorylation site (S2367A) and a constitutively activated S2367 residue (S2367D) were generated by using CRISPR-Cas9.

Results:
Western blotting revealed decreased SPEG protein levels in atrial biopsies from patients with paroxysmal AF in comparison with patients in sinus rhythm. SPEG atrial-specific knockout mice exhibited increased susceptibility to pacing-induced AF by programmed electric stimulation and enhanced Ca2+ spark frequency in atrial cardiomyocytes with Ca2+ imaging, establishing a causal role for decreased SPEG in AF pathogenesis. Phosphoproteomics in hearts from SPEG cardiomyocyte knockout mice identified RyR2-S2367 as a novel kinase substrate of SPEG. Western blotting demonstrated that RyR2-S2367 phosphorylation was also decreased in patients with paroxysmal AF. RyR2-S2367A mice exhibited an increased susceptibility to pacing-induced AF, and aberrant atrial sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ leak, as well. In contrast, RyR2-S2367D mice were resistant to pacing-induced AF.

Conclusions:
Unlike other kinases (PKA, CaMKII) that increase RyR2 activity, SPEG phosphorylation reduces RyR2-mediated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release. Reduced SPEG levels and RyR2-S2367 phosphorylation typified patients with paroxysmal AF. Studies in S2367 knockin mouse models showed a causal relationship between reduced S2367 phosphorylation and AF susceptibility. Thus, modulating SPEG activity and phosphorylation levels of the novel S2367 site on RyR2 may represent a novel target for AF treatment.},

	abstract = {Calcium release from intracellular stores is the signal generated by numerous regulatory pathways including those mediated by hormones, neurotransmitters and electrical activation of muscle. Recently two forms of intracellular calcium release channels (CRCs) have been identified. One, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs) mediate IP3-induced Ca2+ release and are believed to be present on the ER of most cell types. A second form, the ryanodine receptors (RYRs) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, have evolved specialized functions relevant to muscle contraction and are the major CRCs found in striated muscles. Though structurally related, IP3Rs and RYRs have distinct physiologic and pharmacologic profiles. In the heart, where the dominant mechanism of intracellular calcium release during excitation-contraction coupling is Ca(2+)-induced Ca2+ release via the RYR, a role for IP3-mediated Ca2+ release has also been proposed. It has been assumed that IP3Rs are expressed in the heart as in most other tissues, however, it has not been possible to state whether cardiac IP3Rs were present in cardiac myocytes (which already express abundant amounts of RYR) or only in non-muscle cells within the heart. This lack of information regarding the expression and structure of an IP3R within cardiac myocytes has hampered the elucidation of the significance of IP3 signaling in the heart. In the present study we have used combined in situ hybridization to IP3R mRNA and immunocytochemistry to demonstrate that, in addition to the RYR, an IP3R is also expressed in rat cardiac myocytes. Immunoreactivity and RNAse protection have shown that the IP3R expressed in cardiac myocytes is structurally similar to the IP3R in brain and vascular smooth muscle. Within cardiac myocytes, IP3R mRNA levels were approximately 50-fold lower than that of the cardiac RYR mRNA. Identification of an IP3R in cardiac myocytes provides the basis for future studies designed to elucidate its functional role both as a mediator of pharmacologic and hormonal influences on the heart, and in terms of its possible interaction with the RYR during excitation-contraction coupling in the heart.},

	abstract = {Background:
PKA (protein kinase A)–mediated phosphorylation of cardiac RyR2 (ryanodine receptor 2) has been extensively studied for decades, but the physiological significance of PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 remains poorly understood. Recent determination of high-resolution 3-dimensional structure of RyR2 in complex with CaM (calmodulin) reveals that the major PKA phosphorylation site in RyR2, serine-2030 (S2030), is located within a structural pathway of CaM-dependent inactivation of RyR2. This novel structural insight points to a possible role of PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in CaM-dependent inactivation of RyR2, which underlies the termination of Ca2+ release and induction of cardiac Ca2+ alternans.

Methods:
We performed single-cell endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ imaging to assess the impact of S2030 mutations on Ca2+ release termination in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Here we determined the role of the PKA site RyR2-S2030 in a physiological setting, we generated a novel mouse model harboring the S2030L mutation and carried out confocal Ca2+ imaging.

Results:
We found that mutations, S2030D, S2030G, S2030L, S2030V, and S2030W reduced the endoplasmic reticulum luminal Ca2+ level at which Ca2+ release terminates (the termination threshold), whereas S2030P and S2030R increased the termination threshold. S2030A and S2030T had no significant impact on release termination. Furthermore, CaM–wild-type increased, whereas Ca2+ binding deficient CaM mutant (CaM-M [a loss-of-function CaM mutation with all 4 EF-hand motifs mutated]), PKA, and Ca2+/CaMKII (CaM-dependent protein kinase II) reduced the termination threshold. The S2030L mutation abolished the actions of CaM–wild-type, CaM-M, and PKA, but not CaMKII, in Ca2+ release termination. Moreover, we showed that isoproterenol and CaM-M suppressed pacing-induced Ca2+ alternans and accelerated Ca2+ transient recovery in intact working hearts, whereas CaM–wild-type exerted an opposite effect. The impact of isoproterenol was partially and fully reversed by the PKA inhibitor N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide and the CaMKII inhibitor N-[2-[N-(4-chlorocinnamyl)-N-methylaminomethyl]phenyl]-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methoxybenzenesulfonamide individually and together, respectively. S2030L abolished the impact of CaM–wild-type, CaM-M, and N-[2-(p-bromocinnamylamino)ethyl]-5-isoquinoline-sulfonamide–sensitive component, but not the N-[2-[N-(4-chlorocinnamyl)-N-methylaminomethyl]phenyl]-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methoxybenzenesulfonamide–sensitive component, of isoproterenol.},

	abstract = {Current mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) require spontaneous Ca2+ release via cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) channels affected by gain-of-function mutations. Hence, hyperactive RyR2 channels eager to release Ca2+ on their own appear as essential components of this arrhythmogenic scheme. This mechanism, therefore, appears inadequate to explain lethal arrhythmias in patients harboring RyR2 channels destabilized by loss-of-function mutations. We aimed to elucidate arrhythmia mechanisms in a RyR2-linked CPVT mutation (RyR2-A4860G) that depresses channel activity. Recombinant RyR2-A4860G protein was expressed equally as wild type (WT) RyR2, but channel activity was dramatically inhibited, as inferred by [3H]ryanodine binding and single channel recordings. Mice heterozygous for the RyR2-A4860G mutation (RyR2-A4860G+/−) exhibited basal bradycardia but no cardiac structural alterations; in contrast, no homozygotes were detected at birth, suggesting a lethal phenotype. Sympathetic stimulation elicited malignant arrhythmias in RyR2-A4860G+/− hearts, recapitulating the phenotype originally described in a human patient with the same mutation. In isoproterenol-stimulated ventricular myocytes, the RyR2-A4860G mutation decreased the peak of Ca2+ release during systole, gradually overloading the sarcoplasmic reticulum with Ca2+. The resultant Ca2+ overload then randomly caused bursts of prolonged Ca2+ release, activating electrogenic Na+-Ca2+ exchanger activity and triggering early afterdepolarizations. The RyR2-A4860G mutation reveals novel pathways by which RyR2 channels engage sarcolemmal currents to produce life-threatening arrhythmias.},

In both tissues, phosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor has been proposed to be involved in the regulation of Ca2+ release. In the present study, we have examined the ability of the purified cardiac ryanodine receptor to serve as a substrate for phosphorylation by exogenously added catalytic subunit of the cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PK-A), cyclic GMP (cGMP)-dependent protein kinase (PK-G), or calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (PK-CaM). A large amount of phosphate incorporation was observed for PK-CaM (938 +/- 48 pmol of Pi/mg of purified channel protein), whereas the level of phosphorylation was considerably lower with PK-A or PK-G (345 +/- 139 and 96 +/- 6 pmol/mg respectively). In addition, endogenous PK-CaM activity co-migrates with the ryanodine receptor through several steps of purification, suggesting a strong association of the two proteins. This endogenous PK-CaM activity is abolished by a PK-CaM-specific synthetic peptide inhibitor. Endogenous cAMP- and cGMP-dependent phosphorylation was not observed in the purified ryanodine-receptor preparation. Taken together, these observations imply that PK-CaM is the physiologically relevant protein kinase, capable of phosphorylating the channel protein to a minimum stoichiometry of 2 mol of Pi per mol of tetramer.},

The activity of RyRs is regulated by both, cytosolic and SR luminal Ca2+. Deregulation of the CICR, by dysfunctional SR Ca2+ release or uptake, is frequently associated with cardiac pathologies (e.g. arrhythmias, CPVT, heart failure). Recently, the interest to directly measure changes of the free Ca2+ concentration within the SR ([Ca2+]SR) has led to the application of low affinity Ca2+ indicators (mag-fluo-4, Fluo-5N) to follow changes of [Ca2+]SR in cardiomyocytes from some species. However, direct measurement of Ca2+ signals from the SR have not been possible in freshly isolated mouse cardiomyocytes. Here, we show a new protocol optimized to measure changes of [Ca2+]SR in mouse cardiomyocytes using fluorescent Ca2+ indicators and confocal microscopy. The application of this protocol permits the design of experimental studies with direct evaluation of SR Ca2+ in real time in various mouse models of cardiac disease, including transgenic animals harboring mutants of RyRs or other Ca2+ signaling proteins. The technique, in combination with these models, will help to understand how these diseases and mutations affect Ca2+ signals within the SR and the Ca2+ sensitivity of the RyRs for cytosolic and SR luminal Ca2+, thereby contributing to arrhythmias or weak heart beat.},

	abstract = {Aims
In cardiac muscle, phosphorylation of the RyRs is proposed to increase their Ca2+ sensitivity. This mechanism could be arrhythmogenic via facilitation of spontaneous Ca2+ waves. Surprisingly, the level of Ca2+ inside the SR needed to initiate such waves has been reported to increase upon β-adrenergic stimulation, an observation which cannot be easily reconciled with elevated Ca2+ sensitivity of the RyRs. We tested the hypothesis that this change of Ca2+ wave threshold could occur indirectly, subsequent to SERCA stimulation.
Methods and results
Cytosolic and intra-SR Ca2+ waves were simultaneously recorded with confocal line-scan imaging in intact and permeabilized mouse cardiomyocytes using Rhod-2 and Fluo-5-N, respectively. We analyzed changes of several Ca2+ signaling parameters during specific SERCA stimulation by ochratoxin A (OTA), jasmonate or the Fab fragment of a phospholamban antibody. SERCA stimulation resulted in a substantial increase of the threshold for Ca2+ wave initiation. Faster Ca2+ transient decay and SR refilling confirmed SERCA acceleration.
Conclusions
These results suggest that isolated SERCA stimulation can elevate the intra-SR threshold for the generation of Ca2+ waves, independently of RyR phosphorylation. Simultaneously, fractional Ca2+ release and wave amplitudes are reduced. Thus, SERCA stimulation appears to exert a negative feed-back on the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanisms sustaining the waves. Thereby, it may be profoundly antiarrhythmic. This may be clinically relevant when therapies are applied to stimulate the SERCA activity (e.g. SERCA overexpression with gene therapy, future small molecule SERCA stimulators).},

However, the precise mechanisms of action of these enzymes on intracellular Ca2+ handling in normal and diseased hearts remains poorly understood. We have investigated the effects of protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A on spontaneous Ca2+ sparks and SR Ca2+ load in myocytes permeabilized with saponin. Exposure of myocytes to PP1 or PP2A caused a dramatic increase in frequency of Ca2+ sparks followed by a nearly complete disappearance of events. These effects were accompanied by depletion of the SR Ca2+ stores, as determined by application of caffeine. These changes in Ca2+ release and SR Ca2+ load could be prevented by the inhibitors of PP1 and PP2A phosphatase activities okadaic acid and calyculin A. At the single channel level, PP1 increased the open probability of RyRs incorporated into lipid bilayers. PP1-medited RyR dephosphorylation in our permeabilized myocytes preparations was confirmed biochemically by quantitative immunoblotting using a phosphospecific anti-RyR antibody.

	abstract = {Background
Phosphorylation of the cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2) phospho-site S2808 has been touted by the Marks group as a hallmark of heart failure (HF) and a critical mediator of the physiological fight-or-flight response of the heart. In support of this hypothesis, mice unable to undergo phosphorylation at RyR2-S2808 (S2808A) were significantly protected against HF and displayed a blunted response to adrenergic stimulation. However, the issue remains highly controversial because several groups have been unable to reproduce these findings. An important variable not considered before is the genetic background of the mice used to obtain the divergent results.

Methods and results
We backcrossed a RyR2-S2808A mouse into a congenic C57Bl/6J strain, the same strain used by the Marks group to conduct their experiments. We then performed several key experiments to confirm or discard the genetic background of the mouse as a relevant variable, including induction of HF by myocardial infarction and tests of integrity of adrenergic response. Congenic C57Bl/6J harboring the S2808A mutation showed similar echocardiographic parameters that indicated identical progression towards HF compared to wild type controls, and had a normal response to adrenergic stimulation in whole animal and cellular experiments.

Conclusions
The genetic background of the different mouse models is unlikely to be the source of the divergent results obtained by the Marks group in comparison to several other groups. Cardiac adrenergic response and progression towards HF proceed unaltered in mice harboring the RyR2-S2808A mutation. Preventing RyR2-S2808 phosphorylation does not preclude a normal sympathetic response nor mitigates the pathophysiological consequences of MI.},

Serine/threonine protein phosphatases control the dephosphorylation of a variety of cardiac proteins, thereby fine-tuning cardiac electrophysiology and function. Specificity of protein phosphatases type-1 and type-2A is achieved by multiprotein complexes that target the catalytic subunits to specific subcellular domains. Here, we describe the composition, regulation and target substrates of serine/threonine phosphatases in the heart. In addition, we provide an overview of pharmacological tools and genetic models to study the role of cardiac phosphatases. Finally, we review the role of protein phosphatases in the diseased heart, particularly in ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation and discuss their role as potential therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {Aims
Altered Ca2+ handling in atrial fibrillation (AF) has been associated with dysregulated protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and subcellular heterogeneities in protein phosphorylation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This is due to a lack of investigation into the local, rather than global, regulation of PP1 on different subcellular targets such as ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2), especially in AF.

Methods and results
We tested the hypothesis that impaired local regulation of PP1 causes RyR2 hyperphosphorylation thereby promoting AF susceptibility. To specifically disrupt PP1's local regulation of RyR2, we used the spinophilin knockout (Sp−/−) mice (Mus musculus) since PP1 is targeted to RyR2 via spinophilin. Without spinophilin, the interaction between PP1 and RyR2 was reduced by 64\%, while RyR2 phosphorylation was increased by 43\% at serine (S)2814 but unchanged at S2808. Lipid bilayer experiments revealed that single RyR2 channels isolated from Sp−/− hearts had an increased open probability. Likewise, Ca2+ spark frequency normalized to sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content was also enhanced in Sp−/− atrial myocytes, but normalized by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibitors KN-93 and AIP and also by genetic inhibition of RyR2 S2814 phosphorylation. Finally, Sp−/− mice exhibited increased atrial ectopy and susceptibility to pacing-induced AF, both of which were also prevented by the RyR2 S2814A mutation.

Conclusion
PP1 regulates RyR2 locally by counteracting CaMKII phosphorylation of RyR2. Decreased local PP1 regulation of RyR2 contributes to RyR2 hyperactivity and promotes AF susceptibility. This represents a novel mechanism for subcellular modulation of calcium channels and may represent a potential drug target of AF.},

	abstract = {Although the effects and the underlying mechanism of sympathetic stimulation on cardiac Ca handling are relatively well established both in health and disease, the modes of action and mechanisms of parasympathetic modulation are poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that parasympathetic stimulation initiates a novel mode of excitation–contraction coupling that enhances the efficiency of cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca store utilization. This efficient mode of excitation–contraction coupling involves reciprocal changes in the phosphorylation of ryanodine receptor 2 at Ser-2808 and Ser-2814. Specifically, Ser-2808 phosphorylation was mediated by muscarinic receptor subtype 2 and activation of PKG (protein kinase G), whereas dephosphorylation of Ser-2814 involved activation of muscarinic receptor subtype 3 and decreased reactive oxygen species–dependent activation of CaMKII (Ca/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II). The overall effect of these changes in phosphorylation of ryanodine receptor 2 is an increase in systolic Ca release at the low sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca content and a paradoxical reduction in aberrant Ca leak. Accordingly, cholinergic stimulation of cardiomyocytes isolated from failing hearts improved Ca cycling efficiency by restoring altered ryanodine receptor 2 phosphorylation balance.},

	abstract = {Ca2+ is a highly versatile intracellular signal that operates over a wide temporal range to regulate many different cellular processes. This signalling system uses 'on' reactions that introduce Ca2+ into the cell and 'off' reactions that remove it from the cytoplasm.An extensive Ca2+-signalling toolkit is used to assemble cell-specific signalling systems that have very different spatial and temporal dynamics. Channels in the plasma membrane and endoplasmic/sarcoplasmic reticulum are responsible for the on reactions, whereas pumps and exchangers carry out the off reactions.Many of these Ca2+-signalling components are organized into macromolecular complexes in which Ca2+-signalling functions are carried out within highly localized environments. These complexes can operate as autonomous units that can be multiplied or mixed and matched to create larger, more diverse signalling systems, as illustrated by cardiac Ca2+ signalling.Rapid highly localized Ca2+ spikes regulate fast responses, whereas repetitive global transients or intracellular Ca2+ waves control slower responses. Cells respond to such oscillations using sophisticated mechanisms including an ability to interpret changes in frequency, and such frequency-modulated signalling can regulate specific responses such as exocytosis, mitochondrial redox state and differential gene transcription.The operation of Ca2+-signalling systems is constantly under review by an internal quality-assessment mechanism that can respond to changes in the properties of its output signal. We propose the hypothesis that Ca2+ itself has an important function in this internal assessment mechanism by remodelling its own signalling pathway.Several important disease states (hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, manic depression, Alzheimer's disease) might result from abnormal remodelling of Ca2+ signalling. For example, Ca2+ has a prominent role in the remodelling that occurs during both cardiac hypertrophy and congestive heart failure.},
